| [Your First Effect Test](./content/published/patterns/testing/testing-hello-world.mdx) | 🟢 **Beginner** | Write your first test for an Effect program using Vitest and Effect's testing utilities. |
| [Test Effects with Services](./content/published/patterns/testing/testing-with-services.mdx) | 🟢 **Beginner** | Learn how to test Effect programs that depend on services by providing test implementations. |
| [Accessing the Current Time with Clock](./content/published/patterns/testing/accessing-current-time-with-clock.mdx) | 🟡 **Intermediate** | Use the Clock service to access the current time in a testable, deterministic way, avoiding direct calls to Date.now(). |
| [Write Tests That Adapt to Application Code](./content/published/patterns/testing/write-tests-that-adapt-to-application-code.mdx) | 🟡 **Intermediate** | A cardinal rule of testing: Tests must adapt to the application's interface, not the other way around. Never modify application code solely to make a test pass. |
| [Use the Auto-Generated .Default Layer in Tests](./content/published/patterns/testing/use-default-layer-for-tests.mdx) | 🟡 **Intermediate** | When testing, always use the MyService.Default layer that is automatically generated by the Effect.Service class for dependency injection. |
| [Mocking Dependencies in Tests](./content/published/patterns/testing/mocking-dependencies-in-tests.mdx) | 🟡 **Intermediate** | Use a test-specific Layer to provide mock implementations of services your code depends on, enabling isolated and deterministic unit tests. |
| [Organize Layers into Composable Modules](./content/published/patterns/testing/organize-layers-into-composable-modules.mdx) | 🟠 **Advanced** | Structure a large application by grouping related services into 'module' layers, which are then composed together with a shared base layer. |

## Observability
Logging, tracing, and metrics

| [Your First Logs](./content/published/patterns/observability/observability-hello-world.mdx) | 🟢 **Beginner** | Learn the basics of logging in Effect using the built-in structured logging system. |
| [Instrument and Observe Function Calls with Effect.fn](./content/published/patterns/observability/observability-effect-fn.mdx) | 🟡 **Intermediate** | Use Effect.fn to wrap, instrument, and observe function calls, enabling composable logging, metrics, and tracing at function boundaries. |
| [Leverage Effect's Built-in Structured Logging](./content/published/patterns/observability/observability-structured-logging.mdx) | 🟡 **Intermediate** | Use Effect's built-in logging functions for structured, configurable, and context-aware logging. |
| [Add Custom Metrics to Your Application](./content/published/patterns/observability/add-custom-metrics.mdx) | 🟡 **Intermediate** | Use Effect's Metric module to instrument your code with counters, gauges, and histograms to track key business and performance indicators. |
| [Add Custom Metrics to Your Application](./content/published/patterns/observability/observability-custom-metrics.mdx) | 🟡 **Intermediate** | Use Effect's Metric module to instrument your code with counters, gauges, and histograms to track key business and performance indicators. |
| [Trace Operations Across Services with Spans](./content/published/patterns/observability/observability-tracing-spans.mdx) | 🟡 **Intermediate** | Use Effect.withSpan to create custom tracing spans, providing detailed visibility into the performance and flow of your application's operations. |
| [Trace Operations Across Services with Spans](./content/published/patterns/observability/trace-operations-with-spans.mdx) | 🟡 **Intermediate** | Use Effect.withSpan to create custom tracing spans, providing detailed visibility into the performance and flow of your application's operations. |
| [Integrate Effect Tracing with OpenTelemetry](./content/published/patterns/observability/observability-opentelemetry.mdx) | 🟠 **Advanced** | Connect Effect's tracing spans to OpenTelemetry for end-to-end distributed tracing and visualization. |

| [Set Up Your Effect Development Environment](./content/published/patterns/tooling-and-debugging/tooling-hello-world.mdx) | 🟢 **Beginner** | Configure your editor and tools for the best Effect development experience. |
| [Supercharge Your Editor with the Effect LSP](./content/published/patterns/tooling-and-debugging/supercharge-your-editor-with-the-effect-lsp.mdx) | 🟡 **Intermediate** | Install the Effect Language Server (LSP) extension for your editor to get rich, inline type information and enhanced error checking for your Effect code. |
| [Teach your AI Agents Effect with the MCP Server](./content/published/patterns/tooling-and-debugging/teach-your-ai-agents-effect-with-the-mcp-server.mdx) | 🟠 **Advanced** | Use the Effect MCP server to provide live, contextual information about your application's structure directly to AI coding agents. |

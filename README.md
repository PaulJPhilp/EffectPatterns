| [String Validation and Refinements](./content/published/patterns/schema/primitives/string-validation.mdx) | 🟢 **Beginner** | Raw strings need constraints: minimum length for passwords, maximum length for tweets, email format, URL format. Without validation, invalid strings propagate through your system causing errors far... |
| [Tuple Schemas](./content/published/patterns/schema/arrays/tuples.mdx) | 🟢 **Beginner** | Sometimes you need fixed-length arrays where each position has a specific type. A coordinate is [x, y], an RGB color is [r, g, b], a range is [start, end]. Regular arrays allow any length. You need... |
| [URL Validation](./content/published/patterns/schema/web-standards-validation/url.mdx) | 🟢 **Beginner** | You accept URLs from users—as links, webhooks, or API endpoints. A string type doesn't validate that it's actually a valid URL. Users submit malformed URLs like "htp://example" or "not a url". You... |
| [UUID Validation (v4, v7)](./content/published/patterns/schema/web-standards-validation/uuid.mdx) | 🟢 **Beginner** | Your API accepts IDs as strings, but there's no validation that they're actually valid UUIDs.

## Core Concepts

| Pattern | Skill Level | Summary |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Understand that Effects are Lazy Blueprints](content/effects-are-lazy.mdx) | 游릭 **Beginner** | An Effect is a lazy, immutable blueprint describing a computation, which does nothing until it is explicitly executed by a runtime. |
| [Create Pre-resolved Effects with succeed and fail](content/create-pre-resolved-effect.mdx) | 游릭 **Beginner** | Use `Effect.succeed(value)` for immediate success and `Effect.fail(error)` for immediate failure. |
| [Wrap Synchronous Computations with sync and try](content/wrap-synchronous-computations.mdx) | 游릭 **Beginner** | Use `Effect.sync` for non-throwing synchronous code and `Effect.try` for synchronous code that might throw an exception. |
| [Transform Effect Values with map and flatMap](content/transform-effect-values.mdx) | 游릭 **Beginner** | Use `Effect.map` for synchronous transformations and `Effect.flatMap` to chain operations that return another Effect. |
| [Write Sequential Code with Effect.gen](content/write-sequential-code-with-gen.mdx) | 游릭 **Beginner** | Use `Effect.gen` with `yield*` to write sequential, asynchronous code in a style that looks and feels like familiar `async/await`. |
| [Use .pipe for Composition](content/use-pipe-for-composition.mdx) | 游릭 **Beginner** | Use the `.pipe()` method to chain multiple operations onto an Effect in a readable, top-to-bottom sequence. |
| [Control Flow with Conditional Combinators](content/control-flow-with-combinators.mdx) | 游리 **Intermediate** | Use combinators like `Effect.if`, `Effect.when`, and `Effect.cond` to handle conditional logic in a declarative, composable way. |
| [Wrap Asynchronous Computations with tryPromise](content/wrap-asynchronous-computations.mdx) | 游릭 **Beginner** | Use `Effect.tryPromise` to safely convert a function that returns a `Promise` into an `Effect`, capturing rejections in the error channel. |

## Project Setup & Execution

Getting started and running code, from simple scripts to long-running applications.

| Pattern | Skill Level | Summary |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Set Up a New Effect Project](content/setup-new-project.mdx) | 游릭 **Beginner** | Initialize a new Node.js project with the necessary TypeScript configuration and Effect dependencies to start building. |
| [Execute Asynchronous Effects with Effect.runPromise](content/execute-with-runpromise.mdx) | 游릭 **Beginner** | Use `Effect.runPromise` at the 'end of the world' to execute an asynchronous Effect and get its result as a JavaScript `Promise`. |
| [Execute Synchronous Effects with Effect.runSync](content/execute-with-runsync.mdx) | 游릭 **Beginner** | Use `Effect.runSync` at the 'end of the world' to execute a purely synchronous Effect and get its value directly. |
| [Create a Reusable Runtime from Layers](content/create-reusable-runtime-from-layers.mdx) | 游댮 **Advanced** | Compile your application's layers into a reusable `Runtime` object to efficiently execute multiple effects that share the same context. |
| [Create a Managed Runtime for Scoped Resources](content/create-managed-runtime-for-scoped-resources.mdx) | 游댮 **Advanced** | Use `Layer.launch` to safely manage the lifecycle of layers containing scoped resources, ensuring finalizers are always run. |

## Domain Modeling

| Pattern | Skill Level | Summary |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Define Contracts Upfront with Schema](content/define-contracts-with-schema.mdx) | 游리 **Intermediate** | Use `Schema` to define the types for your data models and function signatures before writing the implementation, creating clear, type-safe contracts. |
| [Model Validated Domain Types with Brand](content/model-validated-domain-types-with-brand.mdx) | 游리 **Intermediate** | Use `Brand` to turn primitive types like string or number into specific, validated domain types like `Email` or `PositiveInt`. |
| [Use Effect.gen for Business Logic](content/use-gen-for-business-logic.mdx) | 游리 **Intermediate** | Encapsulate sequential business logic, control flow, and dependency access within `Effect.gen` for improved readability. |
| [Avoid Long Chains of .andThen; Use Generators Instead](content/avoid-long-andthen-chains.mdx) | 游리 **Intermediate** | Prefer `Effect.gen` over long chains of `.andThen` for sequential logic to improve readability and maintainability. |
| [Parse and Validate Data with Schema.decode](content/parse-with-schema-decode.mdx) | 游리 **Intermediate** | Use `Schema.decode(schema)` to create an `Effect` that parses and validates unknown data, which integrates seamlessly with Effect's error handling. |

## Error Management

| Pattern | Skill Level | Summary |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Define Type-Safe Errors with Data.TaggedError](content/define-tagged-errors.mdx) | 游리 **Intermediate** | Create custom, type-safe error classes by extending `Data.TaggedError` to make error handling robust, predictable, and self-documenting. |
| [Handle Errors with catchTag, catchTags, and catchAll](content/handle-errors-with-catch.mdx) | 游리 **Intermediate** | Use `catchTag` for type-safe recovery from specific tagged errors, and `catchAll` to recover from any possible failure. |
| [Handle Unexpected Errors by Inspecting the Cause](content/handle-unexpected-errors-with-cause.mdx) | 游댮 **Advanced** | Use `Effect.catchAllCause` to inspect the `Cause` of a failure, distinguishing between expected errors (`Fail`) and unexpected defects (`Die`). |

## API Development

| Pattern | Skill Level | Summary |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Model Dependencies as Services](content/model-dependencies-as-services.mdx) | 游리 **Intermediate** | Abstract external dependencies and capabilities into swappable, testable services using Effect's dependency injection system. |
| [Define Services with the All-in-One Effect.Service Class](content/define-service-with-effect-service.mdx) | 游리 **Intermediate** | Define your service interface and implementation in a single class by extending `Effect.Service`, the standard pattern for Effect v3.14+. |
| [Avoid Manually Creating or Using Context.Tag](content/avoid-manual-context-tag.mdx) | 游리 **Intermediate** | Do not manually create or import `Tag`s for services. Rely on the `Effect.Service` class to manage context tags implicitly. |
| [Compose Layers Using .pipe](content/compose-layers-using-pipe.mdx) | 游리 **Intermediate** | When building dependency injection layers, use `.pipe` to chain `Layer.provide` calls for proper composition. |
| [Leverage Effect's Built-in Structured Logging](content/leverage-structured-logging.mdx) | 游리 **Intermediate** | Use Effect's built-in logging functions for structured, configurable, and context-aware logging. |

## Application Configuration

| Pattern | Skill Level | Summary |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Define a Type-Safe Configuration Schema](content/define-config-schema.mdx) | 游리 **Intermediate** | Use `Effect.Config` primitives to define a schema for your application's configuration, ensuring type-safety. |
| [Provide Configuration to Your App via a Layer](content/provide-config-layer.mdx) | 游리 **Intermediate** | Use `Config.layer(schema)` to create a `Layer` that provides your configuration schema to the application's context. |
| [Access Configuration from the Context](content/access-config-in-context.mdx) | 游리 **Intermediate** | Access your type-safe configuration within an `Effect.gen` block by yielding the `Config` object you defined. |

## Testing

How to test Effect code effectively, reliably, and deterministically.

| Pattern | Skill Level | Summary |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Use the Auto-Generated .Default Layer in Tests](content/use-default-layer-for-tests.mdx) | 游리 **Intermediate** | When testing, always use the `MyService.Default` layer that is automatically generated by the `Effect.Service` class. |
| [Write Tests That Adapt to Application Code](content/write-tests-that-adapt-to-application-code.mdx) | 游리 **Intermediate** | A cardinal rule of testing: Tests must adapt to the application's interface, not the other way around. |

## Contributing

This is a community-driven project, and we welcome contributions! Whether it's a new pattern, a correction, or an improvement to an existing one, your help is valued.

Please read our **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** file for guidelines on how to get started.

## Next Steps: Automation

To ensure this `README.md` stays perfectly in sync with the `content/` directory, a future enhancement will be to create a script that automatically generates these tables by parsing the frontmatter from all `.mdx` files.

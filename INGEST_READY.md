# Ingest Pipeline - Ready to Run! 🚀

## Current Status

### Source Patterns
- **Location:** `content/new/raw/`
- **Count:** 42 MDX files ✅
- **TypeScript:** Will be extracted automatically

### What the Pipeline Will Do

```
Step 1: Extract TypeScript from MDX files (42 files)
   └─> Creates .ts files in content/new/src/

Step 2: Validate all patterns
   └─> Checks frontmatter, structure, code

Step 3: QA Review (quality checking)
   └─> Scores patterns, copies to content/new/qa/

Step 4: Test TypeScript execution
   └─> Runs each .ts file to ensure it works

Step 5: Check for duplicates
   └─> Compares with existing 89 patterns

Step 6: Migrate valid patterns
   └─> Copies to content/raw/ and content/src/

Step 7: Integrate
   └─> Runs full pipeline (test, validate, generate, rules)

Step 8: Report
   └─> Generates detailed reports in content/new/ingest-reports/
```

## Running the Pipeline

```bash
# Run the complete ingest
bun run ingest

# Expected runtime: ~67 seconds (8 stages)
# Expected output: 
#   - TypeScript files extracted: 42
#   - Validated patterns: ~38-40
#   - Tests passed: ~36-38
#   - Duplicates detected: ~2-4
#   - Migrated patterns: ~34-36
#   - Total patterns after: 89 + 34 = ~123
```

## What Gets Created

### During Ingest
```
content/new/
├── src/                              # Created by Stage 1
│   ├── brand-model-domain-type.ts   # ✨ Extracted
│   ├── combinator-filter.ts         # ✨ Extracted
│   └── ... (42 files)
└── ingest-reports/                   # Created by Stage 7
    ├── ingest-report-{timestamp}.json
    └── ingest-report-{timestamp}.md
```

### After Migration
```
content/
├── raw/                              # Updated
│   ├── ... existing 89 patterns
│   └── ... new ~34 patterns ✨
├── src/                              # Updated
│   ├── ... existing 89 files
│   └── ... new ~34 files ✨
└── published/                        # Regenerated
    └── ... all 123 patterns ✨
```

### Regenerated Files
```
README.md                             # Updated with new patterns
rules/
├── cursor/                           # 123 files (was 88)
├── windsurf/                         # 123 files (was 88)
└── by-use-case/                      # Updated categories
```

## Expected Results

Based on the 42 patterns in `content/new/raw/`:

### ✅ Likely Success
- **Patterns with good structure:** ~36-38
- **Tests passing:** ~34-36
- **Successfully migrated:** ~34-36

### ⚠️ Likely Issues
- **Missing TypeScript code:** ~2-4 patterns
- **Validation errors:** ~2-4 patterns
- **Test failures:** ~2-4 patterns
- **Duplicates:** ~2-4 patterns (if any overlap)

### 📈 Final Count
```
Before: 89 patterns
New:    +34 patterns (estimate)
After:  ~123 patterns total
```

## Safety Features

### Won't Break Existing Patterns
- ✅ No modification of existing content/raw/
- ✅ No modification of existing content/src/
- ✅ Duplicate detection prevents conflicts
- ✅ Full validation before migration

### Rollback if Needed
```bash
# If something goes wrong, restore from git
git checkout content/raw/
git checkout content/src/
```

## Monitoring Progress

Watch for these markers in the output:

### Stage 1: Discovery & Extraction
```
✅ brand-model-domain-type (extracted TypeScript)
✅ combinator-filter (extracted TypeScript)
⚠️  pattern-without-code (no TypeScript code found)
```

### Stage 2: Validation
```
✅ pattern-id
❌ incomplete-pattern (2 errors)
```

### Stage 3: Testing
```
✅ pattern-id (245ms)
❌ failing-test (timeout)
```

### Stage 4: Comparison
```
✅ new-pattern - NEW
⚠️  existing-pattern - DUPLICATE
```

### Stage 5: Migration
```
✅ migrated-pattern
```

## After Running

### 1. Check Reports
```bash
# View the markdown report
cat content/new/ingest-reports/ingest-report-*.md

# Or JSON for details
cat content/new/ingest-reports/ingest-report-*.json | jq
```

### 2. Verify Counts
```bash
# Count raw patterns
ls content/raw/*.mdx | wc -l    # Should be ~123

# Count TypeScript files  
ls content/src/*.ts | wc -l     # Should be ~123

# Count published patterns
ls content/published/*.mdx | wc -l  # Should be ~123
```

### 3. Test Everything
```bash
# Run tests on all patterns
bun run test

# Should show ~123 tests passing
```

### 4. Check Generated Files
```bash
# View updated README
head -50 README.md

# Count Cursor rules
ls rules/cursor/*.mdc | wc -l   # Should be ~123

# Count Windsurf rules
ls rules/windsurf/*.mdc | wc -l # Should be ~123
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No TypeScript code found"
**Issue:** MDX file doesn't have a Good Example code block

**Solution:** Pattern will be marked with warnings but won't fail completely

### "Test failed"
**Issue:** TypeScript code doesn't execute

**Solution:** 
1. Check the error in the report
2. Fix the TypeScript code in content/new/src/
3. Re-run ingest

### "Duplicate detected"
**Issue:** Pattern already exists

**Solution:**
1. Review the existing pattern
2. Decide if you want to replace it
3. If yes, delete the old one first
4. Re-run ingest

## Ready? 🎯

Everything is configured and ready to go:

```bash
# Let's do this!
bun run ingest
```

**Estimated time:** 60 seconds  
**Expected new patterns:** ~34-36  
**Final total:** ~123 patterns  

The pipeline will:
- ✅ Extract TypeScript code automatically
- ✅ Validate everything
- ✅ Test all code
- ✅ Detect duplicates
- ✅ Migrate safely
- ✅ Regenerate all outputs
- ✅ Provide detailed reports

Let's grow that pattern library! 🚀

# Phase 1 Status - Ingestion Pipeline

## Issue Encountered

The `effect-mdx` package uses a complex Effect.Service pattern that requires:
1. MdxService (the actual service)
2. MdxConfigServiceSchema (configuration layer)
3. FileSystem layer

The type system is having difficulty resolving these dependencies correctly, showing errors about `MdxServiceSchema` vs `MdxService`.

## Recommended Solution

Use `gray-matter` directly for frontmatter parsing instead of `effect-mdx`. This will:
- Simplify the dependency chain
- Remove the complex layer composition issues
- Still provide proper Effect error handling
- Be more straightforward for simple frontmatter extraction

## Alternative Approach

If you prefer to use `effect-mdx`, we need to:
1. Investigate the exact layer composition pattern the package expects
2. Possibly update effect-mdx to a newer version
3. Or create a simpler wrapper around gray-matter with Effect

## Current Progress

✅ Database schema created (Drizzle + Postgres)
✅ Docker Compose for local Postgres
✅ Migration scripts configured
✅ Parser structure created (needs gray-matter implementation)
✅ Pipeline logic complete (needs parser fix)
✅ CLI script ready

## Next Steps

Would you like me to:
1. **Switch to gray-matter** (recommended - faster, simpler)
2. **Debug effect-mdx** layer composition (more complex, may take time)
3. **Create custom MDX parser** with Effect wrapper

Let me know your preference and I'll proceed immediately.

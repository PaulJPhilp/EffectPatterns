# Module 2: Building a Web Server / Full API

Welcome to Module 2. Having mastered the fundamentals in Module 1, you're now ready to build something tangible and powerful: a production-ready API server.

This module will guide you through the entire lifecycle of an HTTP request. You'll learn how to launch a server, handle incoming requests, perform validation, manage errors gracefully, and structure your application for scalability using Effect's dependency injection system. By the end of this module, you will have the complete skill set to build robust and resilient web services.

### Learning Path

Follow these patterns in order to progressively build your knowledge.

1.  #### [Launch an HTTP Server](./patterns/launch-http-server)

    **Goal**: Launch a simple, effect-native HTTP server to respond to incoming requests.
    This is the "Hello, World!" of Effect web development and the starting point for any API.

2.  #### [Handle a GET Request](./patterns/handle-get-request)

    **Goal**: Define a route that responds to a specific HTTP GET request path.
    Learn to create routers to handle different URLs and methods, moving beyond a single-response server.

3.  #### [Extract Path Parameters](./patterns/extract-path-parameters)

    **Goal**: Capture and use dynamic segments from a request URL, such as a resource ID.
    Essential for building RESTful APIs that operate on specific resources (e.g., `/users/:id`).

4.  #### [Validate a Request Body](./patterns/validate-request-body)

    **Goal**: Safely parse and validate an incoming JSON request body against a predefined Schema.
    A critical pattern for API security and reliability, ensuring you never process untrusted data.

5.  #### [Send a JSON Response](./patterns/send-json-response)

    **Goal**: Create and send a structured JSON response with the correct headers and status code.
    Learn the idiomatic way to return structured data to your API clients.

6.  #### [Handle API Errors](./patterns/handle-api-errors)

    **Goal**: Translate application-specific errors from the Effect failure channel into meaningful HTTP error responses.
    Move beyond generic 500 errors to provide a consistent and useful error-handling experience for your users.

7.  #### [Provide Dependencies to Routes](./patterns/provide-dependencies-to-routes)

    **Goal**: Inject services like database connections into HTTP route handlers using Layer and Effect.Service.
    This is the key to building scalable, testable, and maintainable applications by decoupling your logic from its dependencies.

8.  #### [Make an Outgoing HTTP Client Request](./patterns/make-http-client-request)

    **Goal**: Use the built-in Effect HTTP client to make safe and composable requests to external services.
    Complete the picture by enabling your API to communicate with other microservices or third-party APIs, all within the safety of the Effect ecosystem.

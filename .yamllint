rules:
  # GitHub Actions workflows use context expressions that are valid at runtime
  # but yamllint can't validate them at edit-time. This is expected behavior.

# Note: GitHub Actions context validation (e.g., ${{ secrets.* }}) is handled
# by VS Code's extension, not yamllint. These are safe to ignore as they work
# fine at runtime. Configure VS Code extension settings if needed.

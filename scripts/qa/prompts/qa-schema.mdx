# QA Validation Schema

This prompt defines the JSON schema for validating Effect patterns. The response must be a valid JSON object with the following structure:

## Required JSON Structure

```json
{
  "passed": boolean,
  "errors": ["string"],
  "warnings": ["string"],
  "suggestions": ["string"],
  "tokens": number,
  "cost": number
}
```

## Validation Criteria

### 1. Technical Correctness
- Code examples compile and run
- Imports are correct and complete
- Exports are properly defined
- TypeScript types are accurate
- Effect patterns are implemented correctly

### 2. Documentation Quality
- Clear explanations of concepts
- Complete coverage of the pattern
- Accurate descriptions
- Consistent terminology
- Appropriate examples

### 3. Pattern Adherence
- Follows Effect best practices
- Uses modern Effect patterns
- Avoids anti-patterns
- Proper service layer usage
- Correct dependency injection

### 4. Examples
- Code is runnable
- Demonstrates the pattern effectively
- Has clear "before" and "after" comparisons
- Shows practical use cases
- Includes expected outputs

### 5. Metadata
- ID is unique and descriptive
- Title is clear and accurate
- Skill level is appropriate
- Tags are relevant
- Use cases are practical

## Response Format

When analyzing a pattern, provide specific feedback:

- **errors**: Critical issues that must be fixed
- **warnings**: Minor issues that should be addressed
- **suggestions**: Improvements that would enhance quality

## Example Response

```json
{
  "passed": false,
  "errors": [
    "Code example uses deprecated Effect.Service.Class pattern",
    "Missing explanation of .Default usage",
    "Import statement is incorrect: uses @effect/platform/HttpClient instead of @effect/platform"
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Example could be more concise",
    "Missing TypeScript type annotations"
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "Add comparison with non-Effect approach",
    "Include performance considerations"
  ],
  "tokens": 1250,
  "cost": 0.0025
}
```

Remember to be thorough but constructive in your feedback. Focus on helping improve the pattern quality while maintaining accuracy.

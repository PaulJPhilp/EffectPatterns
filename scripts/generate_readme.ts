## Roadmap & Future Vision

This repository is the foundational layer for a much larger vision. The goal is to evolve this knowledge base into a comprehensive platform for learning and building with Effect.

Our roadmap includes:

### 1. The Effect Patterns Hub Website
A dedicated blog and documentation site built with  **Effect**. This will provide a beautiful, searchable, and interactive interface for browsing the patterns.

### 2. The "Recipes" Section
A collection of end-to-end, practical blueprints for building complete applications. This will go beyond individual patterns to show how they are composed to solve real-world problems, including:
-   Building Enterprise Apps
-   Building SaaS Apps
-   Building Real-time Apps
-   Building Runtimes for AI Agents
-   Building Blogs
-   Building Full APIs
-   Building AI-powered Applications

### 3. The "Learn Effect" Chat App
A specialized, AI-powered chat application. This app will be trained on this knowledge base, allowing developers to ask questions in natural language ("How do I handle retries?") and get synthesized answers, code examples, and links to the relevant patterns.

### 4. AI Agent Integration
Enhancing the scripts that generate machine-readable rulebooks ('rules.md', 'rules.json') from our pattern library. The goal is to create self-contained artifacts that can be directly consumed by AI coding agents like **Cursor** or custom bots, providing them with the full context of our best practices to assist in code generation and refactoring.

### 5. Internal Tooling & Automation
-   **README Generation:** The immediate next step is to create a script that automatically generates the tables in this README by parsing the frontmatter from all '.mdx' files.
-   **Rule Generation:** Continue to enhance and maintain the scripts that generate the machine-readable rulebooks.

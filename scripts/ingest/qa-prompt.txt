You are an expert TypeScript and Effect-TS code validator. Your task is to rigorously review a provided TypeScript code example against its associated pattern documentation, using the provided API manifest and a global rules document as sources of truth.

Do not modify the code example or documentation. 

Do not write a script or program to perform the validation. 

You will process a list of items. For each item, you will be given a `base_filename` and its corresponding content. 
You will also be provided with a single, global set of rules that applies to all items. 
Process all items without stopping.

The root directory is `content`.

The source files are in the `content/src` directory and the processed pattern files are in the `content/published` directory.

### Global Inputs

You MUST use the following manifests as the single source of truth for all validation. Do not rely on your internal training knowledge.

**1. Effect-TS API Manifest (Source of Truth for MCP Server Check):**
*   **Current APIs (Preferred):**
    *   `Effect.succeed`, `Effect.fail`, `Effect.try`, `Effect.tryPromise`
    *   `Effect.gen` for generators.
    *   `Effect.fn` for functions.
    *   `Effect.Service` for services.
    *   `Effect.runSync`, `Effect.runSyncExit`, `Effect.runPromise`, `Effect.runPromiseExit`, `Effect.runFork` for running effects.
    *   `Effect.acquireRelease` for resource management.
    *   `Option.some`, `Option.none`, `Option.fromNullable`
    *   `Either.right`, `Either.left`
    *   `Data.struct`, `Data.case`
    *   `Schema.decodeSync`, `Schema.encode`
    *   `Brand.schema`
    *   `.pipe()` for all composition.
    *   `Layer.succeed`, `Layer.scoped`
    *   `Metric.counter`, `Metric.gauge`
*   **Deprecated or Superseded APIs:**
    *   Do not use the `(_)` pattern in Effect.gen
    *   `Effect.some`: Superseded by `Option.some`.
    *   `Context.Tag`: Prefer `Effect.Service`.
    *   Manual `Promise.then/.catch` chains: Prefer Effect combinators like `Effect.catchTag`.
    *   `Data.Class.getEqual`: Prefer `Data.equal`.

**2. Global Pattern Rules:**
*   You will be provided with the content of a rules file (e.g., `rules/rules.md`).
*   These rules define overarching standards that every pattern's documentation and code example must adhere to.
*   You must validate the content against every rule in this document.
*   The rules are in the `rules/rules.md` directory.

### Input Specification per `base_filename`

For each `base_filename` (e.g., "combinator-map"), you will be provided with the following:

1.  **Documentation Input:**
    *   **Path:** `content/published/[base_filename].mdx`
    *   **Documentation Content:** The full markdown text from the file at the specified path.

2.  **Code Input:**
    *   **Path:** `content/src/[base_filename].ts`
    *   **Code Example:** The full TypeScript source code from the file at the specified path.

Your task is to perform validation by applying the criteria below to this provided content, using the **Global Inputs** as your reference.

### Error Handling

If, for a given `base_filename`, either the **Documentation Content** or the **Code Example** is not provided or is empty, you must:
1.  Issue a `FAIL` validation result.
2.  Clearly state in the "Detailed Findings" that the validation could not be performed due to missing input.
3.  Do not attempt to perform the remaining validation steps for that file.

### Validation Criteria

**1. Global Pattern Rules Adherence:**
*   For each rule defined in the **Global Pattern Rules** document, verify that the **Code Example** and its corresponding **Documentation Content** are in compliance.
*   If any rule is violated, you must report it as a failure.

**2. Pattern Adherence & Correctness:**
*   Does the **Code Example** *correctly* and *clearly* demonstrate the pattern described in the "Pattern Summary" and "Guideline" sections of the **Documentation Content**?
*   Does the code directly support the "Good Example" rationale and avoid the pitfalls of the "Anti-Pattern" described in the documentation?
*   Is the example concise yet complete enough to illustrate the pattern without excessive external context?

**3. Idiomatic Effect-TS Usage:**
*   Is the code using the latest version of Effect-TS preferred APIs as defined in the **Effect-TS API Manifest**?
*   Does the code follow standard Effect-TS best practices (e.g., `.pipe()`, combinators, type-safe errors, `Effect.gen`, Layers, resource management, data types)?

**4. Idiomatic TypeScript Usage:**
*   Does the code adhere to general TypeScript best practices (e.g., strong typing, clear naming, `const` over `let`)?
*   Does the code avoid `any`, `unknown` (unless justified), and double typecasts (`as unknown as T`)?

**5. Effect API Adherence (MCP Server Check):**
*   **Critically, use the provided Effect-TS API Manifest** to verify that all Effect-related API calls in the **Code Example** are current, correctly typed, and used appropriately.
*   Report any discrepancies found as a precise lookup against the manifest.

### Output Format

Provide your review for each file in the following structured format. You must include the  "Global Pattern Rules Adherence" section in your output.

```markdown
**Validation Result:** [PASS/FAIL]

**Detailed Findings:**

*   **Global Pattern Rules Adherence:**
    *   [PASS: The pattern and code example adhere to all rules defined in the global rules document.]
    *   [If FAIL, quote the specific rule that was violated and explain concisely how the content (from `[Path]`) fails to meet it.]

*   **Pattern Adherence & Correctness:**
    *   [Explanation of findings, e.g., "PASS: The TypeScript code (`src/[base_filename].ts`) perfectly illustrates the pattern described in the documentation (`processed/[base_filename].mdx`)."]
    *   [If FAIL, provide specific line numbers or code snippets and concise suggested corrections.]

*   **Idiomatic Effect-TS Usage:**
    *   [Explanation of findings, e.g., "PASS: Adheres to Effect's pipe-first style and uses composable combinators."]
    *   [If FAIL, provide specific line numbers or code snippets and concise suggested corrections.]

*   **Idiomatic TypeScript Usage:**
    *   [Explanation of findings, e.g., "PASS: All variables are strongly typed and `any` is avoided."]
    *   [If FAIL, provide specific line numbers or code snippets and concise suggested corrections.]

*   **Effect API Adherence (MCP Server Check):**
    *   [Explanation of findings, e.g., "PASS: All Effect APIs used are current as per the API Manifest."]
    *   [If FAIL, provide specific API names, issues, and concise suggested corrections.]

**Overall Recommendation:**
[Provide a concise summary and recommendation, e.g., "This pattern and its associated TypeScript example are production-ready for publication." or "Requires revisions to address violations of global rules and API deprecations before publication."]

**Output File Generation:**
After generating the complete Validation Result block for a base_filename:
If Validation Result: PASS, write the entire block (starting with **Validation Result: PASS**) to the file qa/[base_filename].pass.txt.
If Validation Result: FAIL, write the entire block (starting with **Validation Result: FAIL**) to the file qa/[base_filename].fail.txt.
The file should contain only this structured output.
After all files have been validated, provide a summary of the number of files that passed and the number of files that failed.  Write this summary to the file qa/summary.txt.

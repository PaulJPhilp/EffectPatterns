# Create a Service Layer from a Managed Resource

## Guideline

Define a service using `class MyService extends Effect.Service(...)`.   Implement the service using the `scoped` property of the service class. This property should be a scoped `Effect` (typically from `Effect.acquireRelease`) that builds and releases the underlying resource.

## Rationale

This pattern is the key to building robust, testable, and leak-proof applications in Effect. It elevates a managed resource into a first-class service that can be used anywhere in your application. The `Effect.Service` helper simplifies defining the service's interface and context key. This approach decouples your business logic from the concrete implementation, as the logic only depends on the abstract service. The `Layer` declaratively handles the resource's entire lifecycle, ensuring it is acquired lazily, shared safely, and released automatically.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/scoped-service-layer.ts" />

**Explanation:**
The `Effect.Service` helper creates the `Database` class, which acts as both the service definition and its context key (Tag). The `Database.Live` layer connects this service to a concrete, lifecycle-managed implementation. When `program` asks for the `Database` service, the Effect runtime uses the `Live` layer to run the `acquire` effect once, caches the resulting `DbPool`, and injects it. The `release` effect is automatically run when the program completes.

## Anti-Pattern

Creating and exporting a global singleton instance of a resource. This tightly couples your application to a specific implementation, makes testing difficult, and offers no guarantees about graceful shutdown.

```typescript
// ANTI-PATTERN: Global singleton
export const dbPool = makeDbPoolSync(); // Eagerly created, hard to test/mock

function someBusinessLogic() {
  // This function has a hidden dependency on the global dbPool
  return dbPool.query("SELECT * FROM products");
}
```

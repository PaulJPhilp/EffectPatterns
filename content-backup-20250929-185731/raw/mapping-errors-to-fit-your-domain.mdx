## Guideline

When an inner service can fail with specific errors, use `Effect.mapError` in the outer service to catch those specific errors and transform them into a more general error suitable for its own domain.

---

## Rationale

This pattern is essential for creating clean architectural boundaries and preventing "leaky abstractions." An outer layer of your application (e.g., a `UserService`) should not expose the internal failure details of the layers it depends on (e.g., a `Database` that can fail with `ConnectionError` or `QueryError`).

By using `Effect.mapError`, the outer layer can define its own, more abstract error type (like `RepositoryError`) and map all the specific, low-level errors into it. This decouples the layers. If you later swap your database implementation, you only need to update the mapping logic within the repository layer; none of the code that *uses* the repository needs to change.

---

## Good Example

A `UserRepository` uses a `Database` service. The `Database` can fail with specific errors, but the `UserRepository` maps them to a single, generic `RepositoryError` before they are exposed to the rest of the application.

---

## Anti-Pattern

Allowing low-level, implementation-specific errors to "leak" out of a service's public API. This creates tight coupling between layers.

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";
import { ConnectionError, QueryError } from "./somewhere"; // From previous example

// ‚ùå WRONG: This function's error channel is "leaky".
// It exposes the internal implementation details of the database.
const findUserUnsafely = (): Effect.Effect<
  { name: string },
  ConnectionError | QueryError // <-- Leaky abstraction
> => {
  // ... logic that calls the database
  return Effect.fail(new ConnectionError());
};

// Now, any code that calls `findUserUnsafely` has to know about and handle
// both `ConnectionError` and `QueryError`. If we change the database,
// all of that calling code might have to change too.
```

# Use Effect.gen for Business Logic

## Guideline

Use `Effect.gen` to write your core business logic, especially when it involves
multiple sequential steps or conditional branching.

## Rationale

Generators provide a syntax that closely resembles standard synchronous code
(`async/await`), making complex workflows significantly easier to read, write,
and debug.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/use-gen-for-business-logic.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
`Effect.gen` allows you to express business logic in a clear, sequential style,
improving maintainability.

## Anti-Pattern

Using long chains of `.andThen` or `.flatMap` for multi-step business logic.
This is harder to read and pass state between steps.

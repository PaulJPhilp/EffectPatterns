# Set Up a New Effect Project

## Guideline

To start a new Effect project, initialize a standard Node.js project, add
`effect` and `typescript` as dependencies, and create a `tsconfig.json` file
with strict mode enabled.

## Rationale

A proper setup is crucial for leveraging Effect's powerful type-safety
features. Using TypeScript's `strict` mode is non-negotiable.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/setup-new-project.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
This setup ensures you have TypeScript and Effect ready to go, with strict
type-checking for maximum safety and correctness.

## Anti-Pattern

Avoid disabling `strict` mode in your `tsconfig.json`. Running with
`"strict": false` will cause you to lose many of the type-safety guarantees
that make Effect so powerful.

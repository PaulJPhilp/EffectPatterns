## Guideline

When you need to represent a span of time (e.g., for a delay, timeout, or schedule), use the `Duration` data type. Create durations with expressive constructors like `Duration.seconds(5)`, `Duration.minutes(10)`, or `Duration.millis(500)`.

---

## Rationale

Using raw numbers to represent time is a common source of bugs and confusion. When you see `setTimeout(fn, 5000)`, it's not immediately clear if the unit is seconds or milliseconds without prior knowledge of the API.

`Duration` solves this by making the unit explicit in the code. It provides a type-safe, immutable, and human-readable way to work with time intervals. This eliminates ambiguity and makes your code easier to read and maintain. Durations are used throughout Effect's time-based operators, such as `Effect.sleep`, `Effect.timeout`, and `Schedule`.

---

## Good Example

This example shows how to create and use `Duration` to make time-based operations clear and unambiguous.

## Anti-Pattern

Using raw numbers for time-based operations. This is ambiguous and error-prone.

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";

// ‚ùå WRONG: What does '2000' mean? Milliseconds? Seconds?
const program = Effect.log("Waiting...").pipe(Effect.delay(2000));

// This is especially dangerous when different parts of an application
// use different conventions (e.g., one service uses seconds, another uses milliseconds).
// Using Duration eliminates this entire class of bugs.
```

## Guideline

To enable graceful shutdown for a long-running application:
1.  Define services with cleanup logic in `scoped` `Layer`s using `Effect.addFinalizer` or `Effect.acquireRelease`.
2.  Launch your main application `Effect` using `Effect.runFork` to get a `Fiber` handle to the running process.
3.  Set up listeners for process signals like `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C) and `SIGTERM`.
4.  In the signal handler, call `Fiber.interrupt` on your application's fiber.

## Rationale

When a server process is terminated, you need to ensure that it cleans up properly. This includes closing database connections, finishing in-flight requests, and releasing file handles. Failing to do so can lead to resource leaks or data corruption.

Effect's structured concurrency makes this robust and easy. When a fiber is interrupted, Effect guarantees that it will run all finalizers registered within that fiber's scope, in the reverse order they were acquired.

By launching your app with `runFork`, you get a `Fiber` that represents the entire application. Triggering `Fiber.interrupt` on this top-level fiber initiates a clean, orderly shutdown sequence for all its resources.

---

## Good Example

This example creates a server with a "scoped" database connection. It uses `runFork` to start the server and sets up a `SIGINT` handler to interrupt the server fiber, which in turn guarantees the database finalizer is called.

## Anti-Pattern

Letting the Node.js process exit without proper cleanup. If you run a long-running effect with `Effect.runPromise` or don't handle OS signals, pressing Ctrl+C will terminate the process abruptly, and none of your `Effect` finalizers will have a chance to run.

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";
import { app } from "./somewhere"; // From previous example

// ‚ùå WRONG: This will run the server, but Ctrl+C will kill it instantly.
// The database connection finalizer will NOT be called.
Effect.runPromise(app);
```

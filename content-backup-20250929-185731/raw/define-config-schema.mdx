# Define a Type-Safe Configuration Schema

## Guideline

Define all external configuration values your application needs using the schema-building functions from `Effect.Config`, such as `Config.string` and `Config.number`.

## Rationale

This creates a single, type-safe source of truth for your configuration, eliminating runtime errors from missing or malformed environment variables and making the required configuration explicit.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/define-config-schema.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
This schema ensures that both `host` and `port` are present and properly typed, and that their source is clearly defined.

## Anti-Pattern

Directly accessing `process.env`. This is not type-safe, scatters configuration access throughout your codebase, and can lead to parsing errors or `undefined` values.

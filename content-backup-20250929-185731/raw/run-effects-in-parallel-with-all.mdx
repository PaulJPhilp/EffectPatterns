## Guideline

When you have multiple `Effect`s that do not depend on each other's results, run them concurrently using `Effect.all`. This will execute all effects at the same time and return a new `Effect` that succeeds with a tuple containing all the results.

---

## Rationale

Running tasks sequentially when they could be done in parallel is a common source of performance bottlenecks. `Effect.all` is the solution. It's the direct equivalent of `Promise.all` in the Effect ecosystem.

Instead of waiting for Task A to finish before starting Task B, `Effect.all` starts all tasks simultaneously. The total time to complete is determined by the duration of the *longest* running effect, not the sum of all durations. If any single effect in the collection fails, the entire `Effect.all` will fail immediately.

---

## Good Example

Imagine fetching a user's profile and their latest posts from two different API endpoints. These are independent operations and can be run in parallel to save time.

## Anti-Pattern

The anti-pattern is running independent tasks sequentially using `Effect.gen`. This is inefficient and unnecessarily slows down your application.

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";
import { fetchUser, fetchPosts } from "./somewhere"; // From previous example

// ‚ùå WRONG: This is inefficient.
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  // fetchUser runs and completes...
  const user = yield* fetchUser;
  // ...only then does fetchPosts begin.
  const posts = yield* fetchPosts;
  return [user, posts];
});

// Total execution time will be ~2.5 seconds (1s + 1.5s),
// which is a full second slower than the parallel version.
Effect.runPromise(program).then(console.log);
```

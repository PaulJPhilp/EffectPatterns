# Manually Manage Lifecycles with `Scope`

## Guideline

For complex scenarios where a resource's lifecycle doesn't fit a simple `acquireRelease` pattern, use `Effect.scope` to create a boundary for finalizers. Inside this boundary, you can access the `Scope` service and manually register cleanup actions using `Scope.addFinalizer`.

## Rationale

While `Effect.acquireRelease` and `Layer.scoped` are sufficient for most use cases, sometimes you need more control. This pattern is essential when:
1.  A single logical operation acquires multiple resources that need independent cleanup.
2.  You are building a custom, complex `Layer` that orchestrates several dependent resources.
3.  You need to understand the fundamental mechanism that powers all of Effect's resource management.

By interacting with `Scope` directly, you gain precise, imperative-style control over resource cleanup within Effect's declarative, functional framework. Finalizers added to a scope are guaranteed to run in Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order when the scope is closed.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/manual-scope-management.ts" />

**Explanation:**
`Effect.scope` creates a new `Scope` and provides it to the `program`. Inside `program`, we access this `Scope` and use `addFinalizer` to register cleanup actions immediately after acquiring each resource. When `Effect.scope` finishes executing `program`, it closes the scope, which in turn executes all registered finalizers in the reverse order of their addition.

## Anti-Pattern

Attempting to manage multiple, interdependent resource cleanups using nested `try...finally` blocks. This leads to a "pyramid of doom," is difficult to read, and remains unsafe in the face of interruptions.

```typescript
// ANTI-PATTERN: Nested, unsafe, and hard to read
async function complexOperation() {
  const file = await openFilePromise(); // acquire 1
  try {
    const tempFile = await createTempFilePromise(); // acquire 2
    try {
      await doWorkPromise(file, tempFile); // use
    } finally {
      // This block may not run on interruption!
      await deleteFilePromise(tempFile); // release 2
    }
  } finally {
    // This block may also not run on interruption!
    await closeFilePromise(file); // release 1
  }
}
```

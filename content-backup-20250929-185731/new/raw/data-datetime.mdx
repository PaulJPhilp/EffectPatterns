# Work with Dates and Times using `DateTime`

## Guideline

Use the `DateTime` data type to represent and manipulate dates and times in a type-safe, immutable, and time-zone-aware way.  
This enables safe, precise, and reliable time calculations in your applications.

## Rationale

JavaScript's native `Date` is mutable, not time-zone-aware, and can be error-prone.  
`DateTime` provides an immutable, functional alternative with explicit time zone handling and robust APIs for time arithmetic.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { DateTime, Duration } from "effect";

// Create a DateTime for the current instant
const now = DateTime.now(); // DateTime

// Parse from ISO string
const parsed = DateTime.fromISOString("2024-07-19T12:34:56Z"); // DateTime

// Add or subtract durations
const inOneHour = DateTime.plus(now, Duration.hours(1));
const oneHourAgo = DateTime.minus(now, Duration.hours(1));

// Format as ISO string
const iso = DateTime.toISOString(now); // e.g., "2024-07-19T23:33:19.000Z"

// Compare DateTimes
const isBefore = DateTime.before(oneHourAgo, now); // true
```

**Explanation:**  
- `DateTime` is immutable and time-zone-aware.
- Supports parsing, formatting, arithmetic, and comparison.
- Use for all date/time logic to avoid bugs with native `Date`.

## Anti-Pattern

Using JavaScript's mutable `Date` for time calculations, or ignoring time zones, which can lead to subtle and hard-to-debug errors.

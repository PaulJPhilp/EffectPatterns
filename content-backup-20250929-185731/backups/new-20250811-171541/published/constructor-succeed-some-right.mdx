# Lifting Values with `succeed`, `some`, and `right`

## Guideline

Use the `succeed`, `some`, and `right` constructors to lift plain values into the Effect, Option, or Either world.  
This is the foundation for building composable, type-safe programs.

## Rationale

Lifting values into these structures allows you to compose them with other effects, options, or eithers, and to take advantage of all the combinators and error handling that Effect provides.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Effect, Option, Either } from "effect";

const effect = Effect.succeed(42);
const option = Option.some("hello");
const either = Either.right({ id: 1 });

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const effectResult = yield* effect;
  yield* Effect.log(`Effect.succeed result: ${effectResult}`);
  yield* Effect.log(
    `Option.some result: ${Option.isSome(option) ? option.value : "None"}`
  );
  yield* Effect.log(
    `Either.right result: ${
      Either.isRight(either) ? JSON.stringify(either.right) : either.left
    }`
  );
});

Effect.runPromise(program);

```

**Explanation:**  
- `Effect.succeed(value)` creates an effect that always succeeds with `value`.
- `Option.some(value)` creates an option that is always present.
- `Either.right(value)` creates an either that always represents success.

## Anti-Pattern

Passing plain values around outside the Effect, Option, or Either world, or using `null`/`undefined` to represent absence or success.  
This leads to less composable, less type-safe code and makes error handling harder.

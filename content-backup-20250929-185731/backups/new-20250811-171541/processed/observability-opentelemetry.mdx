# Integrate Effect Tracing with OpenTelemetry

## Guideline

Connect Effect's tracing spans to OpenTelemetry to enable distributed tracing, visualization, and correlation across your entire stack.

## Rationale

OpenTelemetry is the industry standard for distributed tracing.  
By integrating Effect's spans with OpenTelemetry, you gain deep visibility into request flows, performance bottlenecks, and dependenciesâ€”across all your services and infrastructure.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/observability-opentelemetry.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
- Start an OpenTelemetry span when entering an Effectful operation.
- The effect you pass to a span wrapper should have an environment of `never` (i.e., `Effect.Effect<never, A, never>`), meaning it is fully provided and does not require additional dependencies.
- Set status and attributes as needed.
- End the span when the operation completes or fails.
- This enables full distributed tracing and visualization in your observability platform.

## Anti-Pattern

Using Effect.withSpan without exporting to OpenTelemetry, or lacking distributed tracing, which limits your ability to diagnose and visualize complex request flows.

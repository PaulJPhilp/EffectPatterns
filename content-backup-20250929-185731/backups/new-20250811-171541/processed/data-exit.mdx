# Modeling Effect Results with `Exit`

## Guideline

Use the `Exit<E, A>` data type to represent the result of running an `Effect`, capturing both success and failure (including defects) in a type-safe way.  
`Exit` is especially useful for coordinating concurrent workflows and robust error handling.

## Rationale

When running or supervising effects, you often need to know not just if they succeeded or failed, but *how* they failed (e.g., error vs. defect).  
`Exit` provides a complete, type-safe summary of an effect's outcome.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/data-exit.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
- `Exit` captures both success (`Exit.succeed(value)`) and failure (`Exit.fail(error)`).
- Use `Exit` for robust error handling, supervision, and coordination of concurrent effects.
- Pattern matching on `Exit` lets you handle all possible outcomes.

## Anti-Pattern

Ignoring the outcome of an effect, or only handling success/failure without distinguishing between error types or defects, which can lead to missed errors and less robust code.

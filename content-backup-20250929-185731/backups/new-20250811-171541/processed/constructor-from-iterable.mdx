# Creating from Collections

## Guideline

Use the `fromIterable` and `fromArray` constructors to create Streams or Effects from arrays, iterables, or other collections.  
This is the foundation for batch processing, streaming, and working with large or dynamic data sources.

## Rationale

Lifting collections into Streams or Effects allows you to process data in a composable, resource-safe, and potentially concurrent way.  
It also enables you to use all of Effect's combinators for transformation, filtering, and error handling.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/constructor-from-iterable.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
- `Stream.fromIterable` creates a stream from any array or iterable, enabling streaming and batch operations.
- `Effect.all` (covered elsewhere) can be used to process arrays of effects in batch.

## Anti-Pattern

Manually looping over collections and running effects or streams imperatively, which loses composability, error handling, and resource safety.

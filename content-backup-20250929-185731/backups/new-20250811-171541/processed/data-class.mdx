# Structural Equality and Hashing with `Data.struct`

## Guideline

Use `Data.struct` to create data types with built-in structural equality and hashing.  
This enables your data types to work seamlessly with Effect's collections, comparisons, and algorithms without manual equality or hash implementations.

## Rationale

Structural equality and hashing are essential for using your data types in sets, maps, and for deduplication.  
`Data.struct` automatically provides these capabilities, making your types immediately compatible with Effect's collection types like `HashSet` and `HashMap`.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/data-class.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
- `Data.struct` creates data types with automatic structural equality and hashing.
- `Equal.equals` can compare `Data.struct` instances by their structure, not reference.
- `Hash.hash` generates consistent hash values for use in collections like `HashSet`.
- These capabilities make your data types immediately compatible with Effect's collections and algorithms.
- Structural equality works recursively, comparing all nested properties for deep equality.

## Anti-Pattern

Relying on reference equality or manual comparison functions for data types, or using plain objects that don't provide structural equality, which can lead to bugs and inconsistent behavior in collections.

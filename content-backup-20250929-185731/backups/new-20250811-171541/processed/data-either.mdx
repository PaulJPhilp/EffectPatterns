# Accumulate Multiple Errors with `Either`

## Guideline

Use the `Either<E, A>` data type to represent computations that can fail (`Left<E>`) or succeed (`Right<A>`).  
This makes error handling explicit, type-safe, and composable.

## Rationale

`Either` is a foundational data type for error handling in functional programming.  
It allows you to accumulate errors, model domain-specific failures, and avoid exceptions and unchecked errors.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/data-either.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
- `Either.right(value)` represents success.
- `Either.left(error)` represents failure.
- Pattern matching ensures all cases are handled.
- You can accumulate errors or results from multiple Eithers.

## Anti-Pattern

Throwing exceptions or using ad-hoc error codes, which are not type-safe, not composable, and make error handling less predictable.

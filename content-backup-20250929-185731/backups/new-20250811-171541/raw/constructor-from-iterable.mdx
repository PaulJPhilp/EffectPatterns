# Creating from Collections

## Guideline

Use the `fromIterable` and `fromArray` constructors to create Streams or Effects from arrays, iterables, or other collections.  
This is the foundation for batch processing, streaming, and working with large or dynamic data sources.

## Rationale

Lifting collections into Streams or Effects allows you to process data in a composable, resource-safe, and potentially concurrent way.  
It also enables you to use all of Effect's combinators for transformation, filtering, and error handling.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Stream, Effect } from "effect";

// Stream: Create a stream from an array
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const numberStream = Stream.fromIterable(numbers); // Stream<number>

// Stream: Create a stream from any iterable
function* gen() {
  yield "a";
  yield "b";
}
const letterStream = Stream.fromIterable(gen()); // Stream<string>

// Effect: Create an effect from an array of effects (batch)
const effects = [Effect.succeed(1), Effect.succeed(2)];
const batchEffect = Effect.all(effects); // Effect<[1, 2]>
```

**Explanation:**  
- `Stream.fromIterable` creates a stream from any array or iterable, enabling streaming and batch operations.
- `Effect.all` (covered elsewhere) can be used to process arrays of effects in batch.

## Anti-Pattern

Manually looping over collections and running effects or streams imperatively, which loses composability, error handling, and resource safety.

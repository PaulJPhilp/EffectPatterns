# Representing Time Spans with `Duration`

## Guideline

Use the `Duration` data type to represent and manipulate time intervals in a type-safe, human-readable, and composable way.  
This enables robust time-based logic for scheduling, retries, timeouts, and more.

## Rationale

Working with raw numbers for time intervals (e.g., milliseconds) is error-prone and hard to read.  
`Duration` provides a clear, expressive API for modeling time spans, improving code safety and maintainability.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Duration } from "effect";

// Create durations using helpers
const oneSecond = Duration.seconds(1);
const fiveMinutes = Duration.minutes(5);
const twoHours = Duration.hours(2);

// Add, subtract, and compare durations
const total = Duration.add(oneSecond, fiveMinutes); // 5 min 1 sec
const isLonger = Duration.greaterThan(twoHours, fiveMinutes); // true

// Convert to milliseconds or ISO string
const ms = Duration.toMillis(fiveMinutes); // 300000
const iso = Duration.toISOString(oneSecond); // "PT1S"
```

**Explanation:**  
- `Duration` is immutable and type-safe.
- Use helpers for common intervals and arithmetic for composition.
- Prefer `Duration` over raw numbers for all time-based logic.

## Anti-Pattern

Using raw numbers (e.g., `5000` for 5 seconds) for time intervals, which is error-prone, hard to read, and less maintainable.

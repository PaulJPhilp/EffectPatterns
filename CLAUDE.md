# CLAUDE.md

For **architecture** (workspace layout, MCP server, database, config, commands, debugging, important files), use:

- **[docs/Architecture.md](docs/Architecture.md)** – single source for all architecture context and instructions.
- **[docs/Effect-Patterns-Rules.md](docs/Effect-Patterns-Rules.md)** – canonical Effect Patterns rules for all AI tools.

Run commands from the **project root**. Use **Bun** and **workspace:\*** dependencies; no TypeScript path aliases.

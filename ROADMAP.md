# Effect Patterns Hub - Roadmap

Future enhancements and planned features for the Effect Patterns Hub CLI and infrastructure.

## High Priority

### Package Manager Support
**Status:** Planned
**Priority:** High
**Description:** Add support for npm and pnpm in addition to Bun

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add npm/pnpm installation instructions

- [ ] Add `engines` field to package.json
- [ ] Test all commands with node runtime
- [ ] Update documentation for multi-package-manager support
- [ ] Add CI/CD tests for npm and pnpm

**Considerations:**
- Keep Bun as recommended/default
- Ensure all Effect-TS code works with Node.js
- May need different lock files (package-lock.json, pnpm-lock.yaml)
- Performance differences between runtimes

### Re-enable Effect-TS Linter

- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Remove `if (false)` wrapper from linter commands
- [ ] Add linter to CI/CD pipeline

**Linter Rules:**
1. `effect-use-taperror` - Use Effect.tapError for logging
2. `effect-explicit-concurrency` - Require concurrency option
3. `effect-deprecated-api` - Detect deprecated APIs
4. `effect-prefer-pipe` - Suggest pipe for long chains
5. `effect-stream-memory` - Catch non-streaming operations
6. `effect-error-model` - Suggest typed errors

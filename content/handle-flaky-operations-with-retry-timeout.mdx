## Guideline

To build robust applications that can withstand unreliable external systems, apply two key operators to your effects:
-   **`Effect.retry(policy)`**: To automatically re-run a failing effect according to a schedule.
-   **`Effect.timeout(duration)`**: To interrupt an effect that takes too long to complete.

---

## Rationale

In distributed systems, failure is normal. APIs can fail intermittently, and network latency can spike. Hard-coding your application to try an operation only once makes it brittle.

-   **Retries:** The `Effect.retry` operator, combined with a `Schedule` policy, provides a powerful, declarative way to handle transient failures. Instead of writing complex `try/catch` loops, you can simply define a policy like "retry 3 times, with an exponential backoff delay between attempts."

-   **Timeouts:** An operation might not fail, but instead hang indefinitely. `Effect.timeout` prevents this by racing your effect against a timer. If your effect doesn't complete within the specified duration, it is automatically interrupted, preventing your application from getting stuck.

Combining these two patterns is a best practice for any interaction with an external service.

## Good Example

This program attempts to fetch data from a flaky API. It will retry the request up to 3 times with increasing delays if it fails. It will also give up entirely if any single attempt takes longer than 2 seconds.

```typescript
import { Effect, Schedule, Duration } from "effect";

// A flaky API call that might fail or be slow
const flakyApiCall = Effect.tryPromise({
  try: async () => {
    if (Math.random() > 0.3) {
      console.log("API call failed, will retry...");
      throw new Error("API Error");
    }
    await new Promise((res) => setTimeout(res, Math.random() * 3000)); // Slow call
    return { data: "some important data" };
  },
  catch: () => "ApiError" as const,
});

// Define a retry policy: exponential backoff, up to 3 retries
const retryPolicy = Schedule.exponential("100 millis").pipe(
  Schedule.compose(Schedule.recurs(3)),
);

const program = flakyApiCall.pipe(
  // Apply the timeout to each individual attempt
  Effect.timeout("2 seconds"),
  // Apply the retry policy to the entire timed-out effect
  Effect.retry(retryPolicy),
);

Effect.runPromise(program).then(console.log).catch(console.error);
```

## Anti-Pattern

Writing manual retry and timeout logic. This is verbose, complex, and easy to get wrong. It clutters your business logic with concerns that Effect can handle declaratively.

```typescript
// ‚ùå WRONG: Manual, complex, and error-prone logic.
async function manualRetryAndTimeout() {
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    try {
      const controller = new AbortController();
      const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 2000);

      const response = await fetch("...", { signal: controller.signal });
      clearTimeout(timeoutId);

      return await response.json();
    } catch (error) {
      if (i === 2) throw error; // Last attempt, re-throw
      await new Promise((res) => setTimeout(res, 100 * 2 ** i)); // Manual backoff
    }
  }
}
```

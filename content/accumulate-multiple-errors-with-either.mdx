## Guideline

When you need to perform multiple validation checks and collect all failures, use the ``Either<E, A>`` data type. ``Either`` represents a value that can be one of two possibilities: a ``Left<E>`` (typically for failure) or a ``Right<A>`` (typically for success).

---

## Rationale

The `Effect` error channel is designed to short-circuit. The moment an `Effect` fails, the entire computation stops and the error is propagated. This is perfect for handling unrecoverable errors like a lost database connection.

However, for tasks like validating a user's input, this is poor user experience. You want to show the user all of their mistakes at once.

`Either` is the solution. Since it's a pure data structure, you can run multiple checks that each return an `Either`, and then combine the results to accumulate all the `Left` (error) values. The `Effect/Schema` module uses this pattern internally to provide powerful error accumulation.

---

## Good Example

Using `Schema.decode` with the `allErrors: true` option demonstrates this pattern perfectly. The underlying mechanism uses `Either` to collect all parsing errors into an array instead of stopping at the first one.

## Anti-Pattern

Using `Effect`'s error channel for validation that requires multiple error messages. The code below will only ever report the first error it finds, because `Effect.fail` short-circuits the entire `Effect.gen` block.

````typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";

const validateWithEffect = (input: { name: string; email: string }) =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    if (input.name.length < 3) {
      // The program will fail here and never check the email.
      return yield* Effect.fail("Name is too short.");
    }
    if (!input.email.includes("@")) {
      return yield* Effect.fail("Email is invalid.");
    }
    return yield* Effect.succeed(input);
  });

## Guideline

To handle specific URL paths, create individual routes using `Http.router` functions (like `Http.router.get`) and combine them into a single `Http.App`.

---

## Rationale

A real application needs to respond differently to different URLs. The `Http.router` provides a declarative, type-safe, and composable way to manage this routing logic. Instead of a single handler with complex conditional logic, you define many small, focused handlers and assign them to specific paths and HTTP methods.

This approach has several advantages:

1.  **Declarative and Readable**: Your code clearly expresses the mapping between a URL path and its behavior, making the application's structure easy to understand.
2.  **Composability**: Routers are just values that can be created, combined, and passed around. This makes it easy to organize routes into logical groups (e.g., a `userRoutes` router and a `productRoutes` router) and merge them.
3.  **Type Safety**: The router ensures that the handler for a route is only ever called for a matching request, simplifying the logic within the handler itself.
4.  **Integration**: Each route handler is an `Effect`, meaning it has full access to dependency injection, structured concurrency, and integrated error handling, just like any other part of an Effect application.

## Good Example

This example defines two separate GET routes, one for the root path (`/`) and one for `/hello`. We create an empty router and add each route to it. The resulting `app` is then served. The router automatically handles sending a `404 Not Found` response for any path that doesn't match.

```typescript
import { Effect } from 'effect';
import { Http, NodeHttpServer, NodeRuntime } from '@effect/platform-node';

// Define a handler for the root path
const rootRoute = Http.router.get(
  '/',
  Effect.succeed(Http.response.text('Welcome to the home page!'))
);

// Define a handler for the /hello path
const helloRoute = Http.router.get(
  '/hello',
  Effect.succeed(Http.response.text('Hello, Effect!'))
);

// Create an application by combining multiple routes.
// Start with an empty router and add each route.
const app = Http.router.empty.pipe(
  Http.router.addRoute(rootRoute),
  Http.router.addRoute(helloRoute)
);

// Serve the router application
const program = Http.server.serve(app).pipe(
  Effect.provide(NodeHttpServer.layer({ port: 3000 }))
);

NodeRuntime.runMain(program);

/*
To run this:
- GET http://localhost:3000/ -> "Welcome to the home page!"
- GET http://localhost:3000/hello -> "Hello, Effect!"
- GET http://localhost:3000/other -> 404 Not Found
*/
```

## Anti-Pattern

The anti-pattern is to create a single, monolithic handler that uses conditional logic to inspect the request URL. This imperative approach is difficult to maintain and scale.

```typescript
import { Effect } from 'effect';
import { Http, NodeHttpServer, NodeRuntime } from '@effect/platform-node';

// A single app that manually checks the URL
const app = Http.request.ServerRequest.pipe(
  Effect.flatMap((req) => {
    if (req.url === '/') {
      return Effect.succeed(Http.response.text('Welcome to the home page!'));
    } else if (req.url === '/hello') {
      return Effect.succeed(Http.response.text('Hello, Effect!'));
    } else {
      return Effect.succeed(Http.response.empty({ status: 404 }));
    }
  })
);

const program = Http.server.serve(app).pipe(
  Effect.provide(NodeHttpServer.layer({ port: 3000 }))
);

NodeRuntime.runMain(program);
```

This manual routing logic is verbose, error-prone (a typo in a string breaks the route), and mixes the "what" (the response) with the "where" (the routing). It doesn't scale to handle different HTTP methods, path parameters, or middleware gracefully. The `Http.router` is designed to solve all of these problems elegantly.

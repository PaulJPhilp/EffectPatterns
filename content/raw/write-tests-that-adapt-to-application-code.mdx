# Write Tests That Adapt to Application Code

## Guideline

Tests are secondary artifacts that serve to validate the application. The application's code and interfaces are the source of truth. When a test fails, fix the test's logic or setup, not the production code.

## Rationale

Treating application code as immutable during testing prevents the introduction of bugs and false test confidence. The goal of a test is to verify real-world behavior; changing that behavior to suit the test invalidates its purpose.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/write-tests-that-adapt-to-application-code.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
Tests should reflect the real interface and behavior of your code, not force changes to it.

## Anti-Pattern

Any action where the test dictates a change to the application code. Do not modify a service file to add a method just because a test needs it. If a test fails, fix the test.

# Create a Managed Runtime for Scoped Resources

## Guideline

For services that manage resources needing explicit cleanup (e.g., a database
connection), define them in a `Layer` using `Layer.scoped`. Then, use
`Layer.launch` to provide this layer to your application.

## Rationale

`Layer.launch` is designed for resource safety. It acquires all resources,
provides them to your effect, and—crucially—guarantees that all registered
finalizers are executed upon completion or interruption.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/create-managed-runtime-for-scoped-resources.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
`Layer.launch` ensures that resources are acquired and released safely, even
in the event of errors or interruptions.

## Anti-Pattern

Do not use `Layer.toRuntime` with layers that contain scoped resources. This
will acquire the resource, but the runtime has no mechanism to release it,
leading to resource leaks.

# Use .pipe for Composition

## Guideline

To apply a sequence of transformations or operations to an `Effect`, use the
`.pipe()` method.

## Rationale

Piping makes code readable and avoids deeply nested function calls. It allows
you to see the flow of data transformations in a clear, linear fashion.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/use-pipe-for-composition.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
Using `.pipe()` allows you to compose operations in a top-to-bottom style,
improving readability and maintainability.

## Anti-Pattern

Nesting function calls manually. This is hard to read and reorder.
`Effect.tap(Effect.map(Effect.map(Effect.succeed(5), n => n * 2), n => ...))`

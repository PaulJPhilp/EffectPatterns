# Wrap Asynchronous Computations with tryPromise

## Guideline

To integrate a `Promise`-based function (like `fetch`), use `Effect.tryPromise`.

## Rationale

This is the standard bridge from the Promise-based world to Effect, allowing
you to leverage the massive `async/await` ecosystem safely.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/wrap-asynchronous-computations.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
`Effect.tryPromise` wraps a `Promise`-returning function and safely handles
rejections, moving errors into the Effect's error channel.

## Anti-Pattern

Manually handling `.then()` and `.catch()` inside an `Effect.sync`. This is
verbose, error-prone, and defeats the purpose of using Effect's built-in
Promise integration.

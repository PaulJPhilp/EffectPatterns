# Write Tests That Adapt to Application Code

## Guideline

Tests are secondary artifacts that serve to validate the application. The application's code and interfaces are the source of truth. When a test fails, fix the test's logic or setup, not the production code.

## Rationale

Treating application code as immutable during testing prevents the introduction of bugs and false test confidence. The goal of a test is to verify real-world behavior; changing that behavior to suit the test invalidates its purpose.

## Good Example

```typescript
// 1. Read the actual service interface first.
export interface DatabaseServiceApi {
  getUserById: (id: number) => Effect.Effect<User, NotFoundError>;
}

// 2. Write a test that correctly invokes that interface.
it("should return a user", () =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const db = yield* DatabaseService;
    const result = yield* Effect.either(db.getUserById(123));
    // ... assertions
  }).pipe(Effect.provide(DatabaseService.Default), Effect.runPromise));
```

**Explanation:**  
Tests should reflect the real interface and behavior of your code, not force changes to it.

## Anti-Pattern

Any action where the test dictates a change to the application code. Do not modify a service file to add a method just because a test needs it. If a test fails, fix the test.

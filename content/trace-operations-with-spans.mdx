## Guideline

To gain visibility into the performance and flow of your application, wrap logical units of work with `Effect.withSpan("span-name")`. You can add contextual information to these spans using the `attributes` option.

---

## Rationale

While logs tell you *what* happened, traces tell you *why it was slow*. In a complex application, a single user request might trigger calls to multiple services (authentication, database, external APIs). Tracing allows you to visualize this entire chain of events as a single, hierarchical "trace."

Each piece of work in that trace is a `span`. `Effect.withSpan` allows you to create your own custom spans. This is invaluable for answering questions like:
-   "For this API request, did we spend most of our time in the database or calling the external payment gateway?"
-   "Which part of our user creation logic is the bottleneck?"

Effect's tracing is built on OpenTelemetry, the industry standard, so it integrates seamlessly with tools like Jaeger, Zipkin, and Datadog.

---

## Good Example

This example shows a multi-step operation. Each step, and the overall operation, is wrapped in a span. This creates a parent-child hierarchy in the trace that is easy to visualize.

## Anti-Pattern

Not adding custom spans to your business logic. 
Without them, your traces will only show high-level information from your framework (e.g., "HTTP POST /users"). 
You will have no visibility into the performance of the individual steps *inside* your request handler, making it very difficult to pinpoint bottlenecks. Your application's logic remains a "black box" in your traces.

## Guideline

To launch a long-running application (like a server or daemon) as a non-blocking, top-level process, use `Effect.runFork`. It immediately returns a `Fiber` representing your running application, which you can use to manage its lifecycle.

---

## Rationale

Unlike `Effect.runPromise`, which waits for the effect to complete, `Effect.runFork` starts the effect and immediately returns a `Fiber`. This is the ideal way to run an application that is meant to run forever, because it gives you a handle to the process.

The most critical use case for this is enabling graceful shutdown. You can start your application with `runFork`, and then set up listeners for OS signals (like `SIGINT` for Ctrl+C). When a shutdown signal is received, you call `Fiber.interrupt` on the application fiber, which guarantees that all finalizers (like closing database connections) are run before the process exits.

---

## Good Example

This example starts a simple "server" that runs forever. We use `runFork` to launch it and then use the returned `Fiber` to shut it down gracefully after 5 seconds.

## Anti-Pattern

Using `runFork` when you immediately need the result of the effect. If you call `runFork` and then immediately call `Fiber.join` on the result, you have simply implemented a more complex and less direct version of `runPromise`.

```typescript
import { Effect, Fiber } from "effect";

const someEffect = Effect.succeed(42);

// ‚ùå WRONG: This is just a complicated way to write `Effect.runPromise(someEffect)`
const resultPromise = Effect.runFork(someEffect).pipe(Fiber.join, Effect.runPromise);
```

**Validation Result:** PASS

**Detailed Findings:**

*   **Global Pattern Rules Adherence:**
    *   PASS: The pattern and code example adhere to the specific rule "Create a reusable runtime from layers." The code correctly demonstrates using `Effect.Service` pattern, `Effect.log` for structured logging, `Layer.toRuntime` for runtime creation, and proper runtime-based execution.

*   **Pattern Adherence & Correctness:**
    *   PASS: The TypeScript code (`src/create-reusable-runtime-from-layers.ts`) perfectly illustrates the pattern described in the documentation (`published/create-reusable-runtime-from-layers.mdx`). The code demonstrates the exact guideline: creating a service with Effect.Service, compiling layers into a runtime, and reusing the runtime for efficient execution.

*   **Idiomatic Effect-TS Usage:**
    *   PASS: Adheres to Effect's current APIs and best practices. Uses `Effect.Service`, `Effect.sync`, `Layer.toRuntime`, `Effect.scoped`, `Effect.runSync`, `Runtime.runPromise`, and `Effect.log` correctly. The code follows proper structured logging and demonstrates Effect's runtime creation pattern effectively.

*   **Idiomatic TypeScript Usage:**
    *   PASS: Clean code structure with appropriate use of `const` declarations, proper class definitions, and strong typing throughout. The runtime creation pattern is well-implemented with proper service definition and execution.

*   **Effect API Adherence (MCP Server Check):**
    *   PASS: All Effect APIs used are current as per the API Manifest. `Effect.Service`, `Effect.sync`, `Layer.toRuntime`, `Effect.scoped`, `Effect.runSync`, `Runtime.runPromise`, and `Effect.log` are all preferred current APIs for reusable runtime creation patterns.

**Overall Recommendation:**
This pattern and its associated TypeScript example are production-ready for publication. The code excellently demonstrates reusable runtime creation from layers with proper service definition, structured logging, and current Effect-TS best practices.

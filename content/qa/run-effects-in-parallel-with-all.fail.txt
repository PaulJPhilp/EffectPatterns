**Validation Result:** FAIL

**Detailed Findings:**

*   **Global Pattern Rules Adherence:**
    *   FAIL: The pattern violates the global rule "Leverage Effect's built-in structured logging." The code uses direct `console.log` on line 18 instead of using Effect's structured logging system with `Effect.log` or `Effect.logInfo`. This breaks consistency with Effect's logging paradigm and makes the logging less structured and harder to manage.

*   **Pattern Adherence & Correctness:**
    *   PASS: The TypeScript code (`src/run-effects-in-parallel-with-all.ts`) correctly demonstrates the pattern described in the documentation (`published/run-effects-in-parallel-with-all.mdx`). The code properly shows how to use `Effect.all` to run multiple independent effects concurrently and collect all their results into a single tuple.

*   **Idiomatic Effect-TS Usage:**
    *   PARTIAL: While the code correctly uses `Effect.succeed`, `Effect.delay`, `Effect.all`, and `Effect.runPromise`, it breaks the functional paradigm by using direct `console.log` instead of staying within the Effect ecosystem for logging operations. The parallel execution patterns are implemented correctly.

*   **Idiomatic TypeScript Usage:**
    *   PASS: Clean code structure with appropriate use of `const` declarations, proper function composition, and strong typing throughout. The parallel execution patterns are well-implemented with clear demonstration of concurrent effect coordination capabilities.

*   **Effect API Adherence (MCP Server Check):**
    *   PASS: All Effect APIs used are current as per the API Manifest. `Effect.succeed`, `Effect.delay`, `Effect.all`, and `Effect.runPromise` are all preferred current APIs for parallel execution patterns.

**Overall Recommendation:**
Requires revisions to replace the direct `console.log` statement with Effect's structured logging (`Effect.log` or `Effect.logInfo`) to maintain consistency with Effect's functional programming principles and global coding rules. The core parallel execution pattern implementation is correct but needs to follow Effect's logging paradigm.

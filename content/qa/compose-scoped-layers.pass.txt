**Validation Result:** PASS

**Detailed Findings:**

*   **Global Pattern Rules Adherence:**
    *   PASS: The pattern and code example adhere to the specific rule "Compose multiple scoped layers using `Layer.merge` or by providing one layer to another." The code correctly demonstrates using `Layer.merge` to combine multiple independent service layers into a single application layer.

*   **Pattern Adherence & Correctness:**
    *   PASS: The TypeScript code (`src/compose-scoped-layers.ts`) perfectly illustrates the pattern described in the documentation (`published/compose-scoped-layers.mdx`). The code demonstrates the exact guideline: combining multiple resource-managing layers using `Layer.merge`, showing proper service composition and dependency management. The example clearly shows how Effect handles resource acquisition and release order automatically.

*   **Idiomatic Effect-TS Usage:**
    *   PASS: Adheres to Effect's current APIs and best practices. Uses `Effect.Service` pattern (preferred over Context.Tag), `Layer.merge`, `Effect.gen`, `Effect.sync`, `Console.log`, `Effect.provide`, and `Effect.runPromise` correctly. The code follows proper layered architecture and demonstrates clean service composition patterns.

*   **Idiomatic TypeScript Usage:**
    *   PASS: Strong typing is maintained throughout with proper interface definitions for service operations. Clean naming conventions, appropriate use of `const` declarations, and proper generic type usage. The service interfaces are well-defined with explicit return types.

*   **Effect API Adherence (MCP Server Check):**
    *   PASS: All Effect APIs used are current as per the API Manifest. `Effect.Service`, `Layer.merge`, `Effect.gen`, `Effect.sync`, `Console.log`, `Effect.provide`, and `Effect.runPromise` are all preferred current APIs.

**Overall Recommendation:**
This pattern and its associated TypeScript example are production-ready for publication. The code excellently demonstrates layer composition with clean architecture, proper service definition, and current Effect-TS best practices.

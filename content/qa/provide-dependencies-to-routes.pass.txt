**Validation Result:** PASS

**Detailed Findings:**

*   **Global Pattern Rules Adherence:**
    *   PASS: The pattern and code example adhere to the global rule "Leverage Effect's built-in structured logging." The code correctly uses `Effect.logInfo` for all logging operations throughout the program, avoiding direct `console.log` usage and maintaining consistency with Effect's logging paradigm.

*   **Pattern Adherence & Correctness:**
    *   PASS: The TypeScript code (`src/provide-dependencies-to-routes.ts`) perfectly illustrates the pattern described in the documentation (`published/provide-dependencies-to-routes.mdx`). The code demonstrates the exact guideline: using `Effect.Service` to define dependencies and providing them to HTTP routes using layers and dependency injection.

*   **Idiomatic Effect-TS Usage:**
    *   PASS: Adheres to Effect's current APIs and best practices. Uses `Effect.Service`, `Data.TaggedError`, `Effect.succeed`, `Effect.fail`, `Effect.flatMap`, `HttpRouter.params`, `HttpResponse.json`, `HttpRouter.get`, `HttpServer.serveEffect`, `Effect.provide`, `NodeHttpServer.layer`, `Effect.gen`, `Effect.logInfo`, `Effect.scoped`, `Effect.fork`, `Effect.sleep`, `Fiber.interrupt`, and `NodeRuntime.runMain` correctly. The code follows proper dependency injection patterns and demonstrates Effect's service system effectively.

*   **Idiomatic TypeScript Usage:**
    *   PASS: Clean code structure with appropriate use of class definitions for services and tagged errors, proper function signatures, and strong typing throughout. The dependency injection patterns are well-implemented with clear demonstration of service composition and HTTP server integration capabilities.

*   **Effect API Adherence (MCP Server Check):**
    *   PASS: All Effect APIs used are current as per the API Manifest. All the APIs used are preferred current APIs for HTTP server dependency injection patterns.

**Overall Recommendation:**
This pattern and its associated TypeScript example are production-ready for publication. The code excellently demonstrates Effect's dependency injection system with proper usage of services, layers, HTTP routing, and current Effect-TS best practices.

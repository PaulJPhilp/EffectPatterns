**Validation Result:** PASS

**Detailed Findings:**

*   **Global Pattern Rules Adherence:**
    *   PASS: The pattern and code example adhere to the global rule "Leverage Effect's built-in structured logging." The code correctly uses `Effect.log` for all logging operations throughout the program, avoiding direct `console.log` usage and maintaining consistency with Effect's logging paradigm.

*   **Pattern Adherence & Correctness:**
    *   PASS: The TypeScript code (`src/mocking-dependencies-in-tests.ts`) perfectly illustrates the pattern described in the documentation (`published/mocking-dependencies-in-tests.mdx`). The code demonstrates the exact guideline: using test-specific `Layer` to provide mock implementations of services, enabling isolated and deterministic unit tests.

*   **Idiomatic Effect-TS Usage:**
    *   PASS: Adheres to Effect's current APIs and best practices. Uses `Effect.Service`, `Effect.gen`, `Effect.log`, `Effect.sync`, `Layer.succeed`, and `Effect.provide` correctly. The code follows proper dependency injection patterns and demonstrates Effect's testing system effectively.

*   **Idiomatic TypeScript Usage:**
    *   PASS: Clean code structure with appropriate use of interface definitions, class definitions for services, proper function signatures, and strong typing throughout. The mocking patterns are well-implemented with clear demonstration of dependency injection and test isolation capabilities.

*   **Effect API Adherence (MCP Server Check):**
    *   PASS: All Effect APIs used are current as per the API Manifest. `Effect.Service`, `Effect.gen`, `Effect.log`, `Effect.sync`, `Layer.succeed`, and `Effect.provide` are all preferred current APIs for testing and dependency injection patterns.

**Overall Recommendation:**
This pattern and its associated TypeScript example are production-ready for publication. The code excellently demonstrates Effect's testing system with proper usage of mock layers, dependency injection, and current Effect-TS best practices.

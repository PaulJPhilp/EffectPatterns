**Validation Result:** FAIL

**Detailed Findings:**

*   **Global Pattern Rules Adherence:**
    *   FAIL: The pattern violates the global rule "Leverage Effect's built-in structured logging." The code uses direct `console.log` on lines 8 and 46 instead of using Effect's structured logging system with `Effect.log` or `Effect.logInfo`. This breaks consistency with Effect's logging paradigm and makes the logging less structured and harder to manage.

*   **Pattern Adherence & Correctness:**
    *   PASS: The TypeScript code (`src/organize-layers-into-composable-modules.ts`) correctly demonstrates the pattern described in the documentation (`published/organize-layers-into-composable-modules.mdx`). The code properly shows how to organize services into modular layers with hierarchical composition, using `Effect.Service` with dependencies and proper layer organization.

*   **Idiomatic Effect-TS Usage:**
    *   PARTIAL: While the code correctly uses `Effect.Service`, `Effect.gen`, `Effect.sync`, `Effect.provide`, and `Effect.runPromise`, it breaks the functional paradigm by using direct `console.log` instead of staying within the Effect ecosystem for logging operations. The layer composition patterns are implemented correctly.

*   **Idiomatic TypeScript Usage:**
    *   PASS: Clean code structure with appropriate use of class definitions for services, proper function signatures, and strong typing throughout. The modular layer patterns are well-implemented with clear demonstration of hierarchical composition and dependency management capabilities.

*   **Effect API Adherence (MCP Server Check):**
    *   PASS: All Effect APIs used are current as per the API Manifest. `Effect.Service`, `Effect.gen`, `Effect.sync`, `Effect.provide`, and `Effect.runPromise` are all preferred current APIs for layer composition patterns.

**Overall Recommendation:**
Requires revisions to replace all direct `console.log` statements with Effect's structured logging (`Effect.log` or `Effect.logInfo`) to maintain consistency with Effect's functional programming principles and global coding rules. The core layer composition pattern implementation is correct but needs to follow Effect's logging paradigm.

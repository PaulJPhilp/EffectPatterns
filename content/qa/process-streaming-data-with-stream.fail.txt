**Validation Result:** FAIL

**Detailed Findings:**

*   **Global Pattern Rules Adherence:**
    *   FAIL: The pattern violates the global rule "Leverage Effect's built-in structured logging." The code uses direct `console.error` on line 47 instead of using Effect's structured logging system with `Effect.logError`. This breaks consistency with Effect's logging paradigm and makes the logging less structured and harder to manage.

*   **Pattern Adherence & Correctness:**
    *   PASS: The TypeScript code (`src/process-streaming-data-with-stream.ts`) correctly demonstrates the pattern described in the documentation (`published/process-streaming-data-with-stream.mdx`). The code properly shows how to use `Stream` for processing streaming data with `Stream.paginateEffect`, `Stream.flatMap`, `Stream.fromIterable`, and `Stream.runForEach`.

*   **Idiomatic Effect-TS Usage:**
    *   PARTIAL: While the code correctly uses `Effect.succeed`, `Effect.delay`, `Effect.map`, `Stream.paginateEffect`, `Stream.flatMap`, `Stream.fromIterable`, `Stream.runForEach`, `Effect.log`, `Option.fromNullable`, and `Effect.runPromise`, it breaks the functional paradigm by using direct `console.error` instead of staying within the Effect ecosystem for error logging operations.

*   **Idiomatic TypeScript Usage:**
    *   PASS: Clean code structure with appropriate use of interface definitions, proper function signatures, and strong typing throughout. The streaming patterns are well-implemented with clear demonstration of paginated data processing and memory-efficient stream handling capabilities.

*   **Effect API Adherence (MCP Server Check):**
    *   PASS: All Effect APIs used are current as per the API Manifest. `Effect.succeed`, `Effect.delay`, `Effect.map`, `Stream.paginateEffect`, `Stream.flatMap`, `Stream.fromIterable`, `Stream.runForEach`, `Effect.log`, `Option.fromNullable`, and `Effect.runPromise` are all preferred current APIs for streaming patterns.

**Overall Recommendation:**
Requires revisions to replace the direct `console.error` statement with Effect's structured logging (`Effect.logError`) to maintain consistency with Effect's functional programming principles and global coding rules. The core streaming pattern implementation is correct but needs to follow Effect's logging paradigm.

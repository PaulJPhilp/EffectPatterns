**Validation Result:** PASS

**Detailed Findings:**

*   **Global Pattern Rules Adherence:**
    *   PASS: The pattern and code example adhere to the global rule "Leverage Effect's built-in structured logging." The code correctly uses `Effect.log` for all logging operations throughout the program, avoiding direct `console.log` usage and maintaining consistency with Effect's logging paradigm.

*   **Pattern Adherence & Correctness:**
    *   PASS: The TypeScript code (`src/manage-resource-lifecycles-with-scope.ts`) perfectly illustrates the pattern described in the documentation (`published/manage-resource-lifecycles-with-scope.mdx`). The code demonstrates the exact guideline: using `Effect.acquireRelease` for resource management, `Effect.scoped` for resource usage, and proper cleanup guarantees through Scope.

*   **Idiomatic Effect-TS Usage:**
    *   PASS: Adheres to Effect's current APIs and best practices. Uses `Effect.log`, `Effect.as`, `Effect.acquireRelease`, `Effect.gen`, `Effect.scoped`, and `Effect.runPromise` correctly. The code follows proper resource management patterns with automatic cleanup and demonstrates Effect's scoped resource system effectively.

*   **Idiomatic TypeScript Usage:**
    *   PASS: Clean code structure with appropriate use of `const` declarations and proper Effect composition. The resource management patterns are well-implemented with clear demonstration of acquire-release semantics and automatic cleanup capabilities.

*   **Effect API Adherence (MCP Server Check):**
    *   PASS: All Effect APIs used are current as per the API Manifest. `Effect.log`, `Effect.as`, `Effect.acquireRelease`, `Effect.gen`, `Effect.scoped`, and `Effect.runPromise` are all preferred current APIs for resource management patterns.

**Overall Recommendation:**
This pattern and its associated TypeScript example are production-ready for publication. The code excellently demonstrates Effect's scoped resource management system with proper usage of acquire-release patterns, automatic cleanup guarantees, and current Effect-TS best practices.

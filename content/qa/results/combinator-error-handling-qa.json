    "The code example at `./src/combinator-error-handling.ts` is referenced but not provided. Without the actual code, comprehensive validation of 'Technical Correctness' and 'Examples' criteria (e.g., compilation, runtime, specific implementation details, practical use cases) is not possible."

    "The 'Explanation' section is clear but could be slightly expanded to briefly touch upon the type-level implications of each combinator (e.g., how `catchAll` changes the `E` type, `orElse` typically removes it, and `match` transforms the `Effect<R, E, A>` into a pure value `B`).",
    "While the anti-pattern is mentioned, a very concise side-by-side or 'before/after' code snippet (even a pseudo-code one) directly in the documentation could powerfully illustrate the difference between imperative `try/catch` and declarative Effect combinators."

  "suggestions": [
    "Consider adding a small 'Expected Output' section for the example code, if applicable, to further clarify its behavior.",
    "Elaborate slightly on common scenarios where one combinator might be preferred over another (e.g., `catchAll` for comprehensive error recovery and transformation, `orElse` for providing a simple fallback, `match` for branching logic based on success/failure)."

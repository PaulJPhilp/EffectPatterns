    "The provided `Good Example` path `./src/combinator-filter.ts` is external to this prompt. While the explanation covers its expected content well, including the full code directly within the prompt or showing minimal `Effect.runPromise` calls (or `Stream.runCollect`) with `console.log` for each example would make it immediately runnable and demonstrate concrete outputs, enhancing the 'Examples - Includes expected outputs' criterion. Currently, the explanation describes the outputs rather than showing them via code execution."

    "Consider adding a small, illustrative code snippet for the `Anti-Pattern` description (e.g., a simple `Effect.map().pipe(Effect.flatten())` example that `filterOrFail` would replace) to provide a clearer 'before' comparison and reinforce the rationale for avoiding it."

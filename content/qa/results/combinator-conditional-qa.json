    "The code example specified by `<Example path=\"./src/combinator-conditional.ts\" />` is missing. Without the actual code, full validation of technical correctness, compilation, runtime behavior, and adherence to specific implementation details (e.g., correct imports, TypeScript types, runnable examples) cannot be performed.",
    "The explanation explicitly lists `Effect.when` and `Effect.cond` in the title and general guideline but focuses primarily on `Effect.if` in the 'Good Example' explanation. To fully cover the scope implied by the title, a brief explanation or example of `Effect.when` and `Effect.cond` should be included for completeness within the 'Good Example' description or the actual code."
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "While the distinction between good practice and anti-pattern is clear, explicit code examples illustrating the 'anti-pattern' alongside the 'good example' would enhance clarity and impact, providing a direct 'before' and 'after' comparison rather than just a textual description of the anti-pattern.",
    "The 'Good Example' explanation could benefit from a very brief, high-level description of when to prefer `Effect.if` vs. `Effect.when` vs. `Effect.cond` (e.g., `if` for true/false branches, `when` for executing an effect only if true, `cond` for multiple cases)."
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "Provide a complete, runnable TypeScript code example for `src/combinator-conditional.ts` that effectively demonstrates the use of `Effect.if`, `Effect.when`, and `Effect.cond` for effectful computations, and `if/else` or ternary for `Option`/`Either` construction.",
    "Include expected outputs for the provided code example(s) to clearly show the results of the conditional logic.",
    "To make the anti-pattern even more explicit, consider adding a concise code snippet (e.g., an imperative `if` statement directly within an `Effect.gen` block) to illustrate the problematic usage.",
    "Incorporate a simple, relatable use case scenario (e.g., 'process payment based on user role', 'log message based on verbosity level') into the code example to demonstrate practical application."

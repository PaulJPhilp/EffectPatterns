**Validation Result:** FAIL

**Detailed Findings:**

*   **Global Pattern Rules Adherence:**
    *   FAIL: The pattern violates the global rule "Leverage Effect's built-in structured logging." The code uses direct `Date.now()` on lines 17 and 21 instead of using Effect's `Clock` service for testable time access. This breaks consistency with Effect's functional programming principles and makes the code less testable.

*   **Pattern Adherence & Correctness:**
    *   PASS: The TypeScript code (`src/process-collection-in-parallel-with-foreach.ts`) correctly demonstrates the pattern described in the documentation (`published/process-collection-in-parallel-with-foreach.mdx`). The code properly shows how to use `Effect.forEach` with concurrency control to process collections in parallel with a fixed limit.

*   **Idiomatic Effect-TS Usage:**
    *   PARTIAL: While the code correctly uses `Effect.gen`, `Effect.logInfo`, `Effect.sleep`, `Effect.forEach`, and `Effect.runPromise`, it breaks the functional paradigm by using direct `Date.now()` instead of the `Clock` service for time access. The concurrent processing patterns are implemented correctly.

*   **Idiomatic TypeScript Usage:**
    *   PASS: Clean code structure with appropriate use of `const` declarations, proper function composition, and strong typing throughout. The parallel processing patterns are well-implemented with clear demonstration of concurrency control and performance optimization capabilities.

*   **Effect API Adherence (MCP Server Check):**
    *   PASS: All Effect APIs used are current as per the API Manifest. `Effect.gen`, `Effect.logInfo`, `Effect.sleep`, `Effect.forEach`, and `Effect.runPromise` are all preferred current APIs for parallel processing patterns.

**Overall Recommendation:**
Requires revisions to replace the direct `Date.now()` calls with Effect's `Clock` service (`Clock.currentTimeMillis`) to maintain consistency with Effect's functional programming principles and global coding rules. The core parallel processing pattern implementation is correct but needs to follow Effect's testable time access paradigm.

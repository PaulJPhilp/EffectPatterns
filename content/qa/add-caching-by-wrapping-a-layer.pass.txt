**Validation Result:** PASS

**Detailed Findings:**

*   **Global Pattern Rules Adherence:**
    *   PASS: The pattern and code example adhere to the specific rule "Use a wrapping Layer to add cross-cutting concerns like caching to a service without altering its original implementation." The code correctly demonstrates creating a wrapper layer that requires the original service and provides enhanced functionality without modifying the original implementation.

*   **Pattern Adherence & Correctness:**
    *   PASS: The TypeScript code (`src/add-caching-by-wrapping-a-layer.ts`) perfectly illustrates the pattern described in the documentation (`published/add-caching-by-wrapping-a-layer.mdx`). The code demonstrates the exact guideline: creating a wrapper layer that takes the original service as a dependency and returns a new layer with caching functionality. The implementation shows proper separation of concerns, composability, and explicit dependency management.

*   **Idiomatic Effect-TS Usage:**
    *   PASS: Adheres to Effect's current APIs and best practices. Uses `Effect.Service` pattern, `Layer.effect`, `Layer.succeed`, `Layer.provide`, `Effect.gen`, `Ref.make`, `Ref.get`, `Ref.update`, `Effect.log`, `Effect.flatMap`, `Effect.tap`, `Effect.as`, `Effect.delay`, and `Effect.runPromise` correctly. The code follows proper layered architecture and dependency injection patterns.

*   **Idiomatic TypeScript Usage:**
    *   PASS: Strong typing is maintained throughout with proper service interface definitions. Clean naming conventions, appropriate use of `const` declarations, and proper generic type usage. The non-null assertion operator (`!`) is used appropriately in a context where the map key existence is already verified.

*   **Effect API Adherence (MCP Server Check):**
    *   PASS: All Effect APIs used are current as per the API Manifest. `Effect.Service`, `Layer.effect`, `Layer.succeed`, `Layer.provide`, `Effect.gen`, `Ref.make`, `Effect.log`, `Effect.flatMap`, `Effect.tap`, `Effect.as`, `Effect.delay`, and `Effect.runPromise` are all preferred current APIs.

**Overall Recommendation:**
This pattern and its associated TypeScript example are production-ready for publication. The code excellently demonstrates the wrapper layer pattern with clean architecture, proper separation of concerns, and current Effect-TS best practices.

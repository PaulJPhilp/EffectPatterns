**Validation Result:** FAIL

**Detailed Findings:**

*   **Global Pattern Rules Adherence:**
    *   FAIL: The pattern violates the global rule "Leverage Effect's built-in structured logging." The code uses direct `console.log` calls on lines 56, 61, 65, 66, 67, 70, and 72 instead of using Effect's structured logging system with `Effect.log`.

*   **Pattern Adherence & Correctness:**
    *   PASS: The TypeScript code (`src/accumulate-multiple-errors-with-either.ts`) correctly demonstrates the pattern described in the documentation (`published/accumulate-multiple-errors-with-either.mdx`). The code properly uses `Schema.decode` with `{ errors: "all" }` option to accumulate multiple validation errors, and uses `Effect.either` to handle the Either pattern correctly.

*   **Idiomatic Effect-TS Usage:**
    *   PARTIAL: While the code correctly uses `Effect.gen`, `Schema.decode`, `Effect.either`, `Effect.match`, `Effect.sync`, and `Effect.runSync`, it violates Effect's principle of pure functional programming by using side-effectful `console.log` calls instead of Effect's structured logging system. This makes the code less testable and breaks the functional paradigm.

*   **Idiomatic TypeScript Usage:**
    *   PASS: Strong typing is maintained throughout with proper interface definitions, no usage of `any` or unsafe casts. Clean naming conventions and appropriate use of `const` declarations. The `Data.TaggedError` pattern is correctly implemented.

*   **Effect API Adherence (MCP Server Check):**
    *   PASS: All Effect APIs used are current as per the API Manifest. `Schema.decode`, `Effect.either`, `Effect.match`, `Effect.sync`, `Effect.runSync`, and `Data.TaggedError` are all preferred current APIs.

**Overall Recommendation:**
Requires revisions to replace all direct `console.log` calls with `Effect.log` to maintain consistency with Effect's structured logging principles and global coding rules. The validation logic and Either pattern implementation are correct.

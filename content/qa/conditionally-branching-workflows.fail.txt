**Validation Result:** FAIL

**Detailed Findings:**

*   **Global Pattern Rules Adherence:**
    *   FAIL: The pattern violates the global rule "Leverage Effect's built-in structured logging." The code uses a direct `.then()` callback with `console.log` on line 62 instead of using Effect's structured logging system with `Effect.log`. Additionally, it violates the principle of staying within the Effect ecosystem by using Promise-based `.then()` instead of Effect combinators.

*   **Pattern Adherence & Correctness:**
    *   PASS: The TypeScript code (`src/conditionally-branching-workflows.ts`) correctly demonstrates the pattern described in the documentation (`published/conditionally-branching-workflows.mdx`). The code properly shows how to use predicate-based operators and conditional logic within Effect workflows, with proper error handling and type-safe failure modes.

*   **Idiomatic Effect-TS Usage:**
    *   PARTIAL: While the code correctly uses `Effect.succeed`, `Effect.gen`, `Effect.fail`, `Effect.match`, and `Effect.runPromise`, it breaks the functional paradigm by using `.then()` callback and `console.log` instead of staying within the Effect ecosystem. The conditional logic implementation is correct but the final execution should use Effect combinators.

*   **Idiomatic TypeScript Usage:**
    *   PASS: Strong typing is maintained throughout with proper interface definitions, union types for errors, and type-safe pattern matching. Clean naming conventions, appropriate use of `const` declarations, and proper handling of conditional logic.

*   **Effect API Adherence (MCP Server Check):**
    *   PASS: All Effect APIs used are current as per the API Manifest. `Effect.succeed`, `Effect.gen`, `Effect.fail`, `Effect.match`, and `Effect.runPromise` are all preferred current APIs for conditional workflow control.

**Overall Recommendation:**
Requires revisions to replace the `.then()` callback and `console.log` with Effect's structured logging and combinators to maintain consistency with Effect's functional programming principles and global coding rules. The conditional branching pattern implementation is correct but needs to follow Effect's paradigm.

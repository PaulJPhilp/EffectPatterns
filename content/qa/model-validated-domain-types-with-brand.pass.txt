**Validation Result:** PASS

**Detailed Findings:**

*   **Global Pattern Rules Adherence:**
    *   PASS: The pattern and code example adhere to all global pattern rules. The code does not use direct `console.log`, Promise chains, or other anti-patterns. It maintains functional programming principles throughout.

*   **Pattern Adherence & Correctness:**
    *   PASS: The TypeScript code (`src/model-validated-domain-types-with-brand.ts`) perfectly illustrates the pattern described in the documentation (`published/model-validated-domain-types-with-brand.mdx`). The code demonstrates the exact guideline: using `Brand` to create validated domain types, with proper type safety and validation boundaries.

*   **Idiomatic Effect-TS Usage:**
    *   PASS: Adheres to Effect's current APIs and best practices. Uses `Brand.Brand`, `Option.Option`, `Option.some`, and `Option.none` correctly. The code follows proper branded type patterns and demonstrates Effect's type safety system effectively.

*   **Idiomatic TypeScript Usage:**
    *   PASS: Clean code structure with appropriate use of type definitions, intersection types with Brand, and proper function signatures. The branded type patterns are well-implemented with clear demonstration of type safety and validation capabilities.

*   **Effect API Adherence (MCP Server Check):**
    *   PASS: All Effect APIs used are current as per the API Manifest. `Brand.Brand`, `Option.Option`, `Option.some`, and `Option.none` are all preferred current APIs for branded type patterns.

**Overall Recommendation:**
This pattern and its associated TypeScript example are production-ready for publication. The code excellently demonstrates Effect's branded type system with proper usage of validation boundaries, type safety, and current Effect-TS best practices.

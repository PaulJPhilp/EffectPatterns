**Validation Result:** PASS

**Detailed Findings:**

*   **Global Pattern Rules Adherence:**
    *   PASS: The pattern and code example adhere to the specific rule "Use Http.router.get to associate a URL path with a specific response Effect." The code correctly demonstrates route handling with proper path matching, comprehensive error handling with tagged errors, and structured logging with `Effect.logInfo`, `Effect.logWarning`, and `Effect.logError` throughout the program.

*   **Pattern Adherence & Correctness:**
    *   PASS: The TypeScript code (`src/handle-get-request.ts`) correctly illustrates the pattern described in the documentation (`published/handle-get-request.mdx`). The code demonstrates proper GET request handling with route matching, error handling for not found and handler errors, and service-based architecture for route operations.

*   **Idiomatic Effect-TS Usage:**
    *   PASS: Adheres to Effect's current APIs and best practices. Uses `Data.TaggedError`, `Effect.Service`, `Effect.gen`, `Effect.logInfo`, `Effect.logWarning`, `Effect.logError`, `Effect.fail`, `Effect.catchTags`, `Effect.provide`, and `Effect.runPromise` correctly. The code follows proper structured logging and demonstrates Effect's service pattern effectively.

*   **Idiomatic TypeScript Usage:**
    *   PASS: Clean code structure with appropriate use of `const` declarations, proper interface definitions, strong typing throughout with explicit error union types, and proper error handling patterns. The service-based approach is well-implemented with clear separation of concerns and comprehensive route handling.

*   **Effect API Adherence (MCP Server Check):**
    *   PASS: All Effect APIs used are current as per the API Manifest. `Data.TaggedError`, `Effect.Service`, `Effect.gen`, `Effect.logInfo`, `Effect.logWarning`, `Effect.logError`, `Effect.fail`, `Effect.catchTags`, `Effect.provide`, and `Effect.runPromise` are all preferred current APIs for HTTP route handling patterns.

**Overall Recommendation:**
This pattern and its associated TypeScript example are production-ready for publication. The code excellently demonstrates GET request handling with proper route matching, comprehensive error handling, structured logging, and current Effect-TS best practices.

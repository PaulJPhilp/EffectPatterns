**Validation Result:** PASS

**Detailed Findings:**

*   **Global Pattern Rules Adherence:**
    *   PASS: The pattern and code example adhere to the specific rule "Use Data.struct or implement the Equal interface for value-based comparison of objects and classes." The code correctly demonstrates using `Data.tagged` to create types with structural equality and `Equal.equals` for value-based comparison.

*   **Pattern Adherence & Correctness:**
    *   PASS: The TypeScript code (`src/comparing-data-by-value-with-structural-equality.ts`) perfectly illustrates the pattern described in the documentation (`published/comparing-data-by-value-with-structural-equality.mdx`). The code demonstrates the exact guideline: defining data with `Data.tagged`, comparing with `Equal.equals`, and showing the difference between referential and structural equality.

*   **Idiomatic Effect-TS Usage:**
    *   PASS: Adheres to Effect's current APIs and best practices. Uses `Data.tagged`, `Equal.equals`, `Effect.gen`, `Effect.log`, and `Effect.runPromise` correctly. The code follows proper structured logging and demonstrates Effect's data modeling capabilities effectively.

*   **Idiomatic TypeScript Usage:**
    *   PASS: Strong typing is maintained throughout with proper interface definitions using readonly properties and tagged unions. Clean naming conventions, appropriate use of `const` declarations, and proper generic type usage with `Data.tagged<Point>`.

*   **Effect API Adherence (MCP Server Check):**
    *   PASS: All Effect APIs used are current as per the API Manifest. `Data.tagged`, `Equal.equals`, `Effect.gen`, `Effect.log`, and `Effect.runPromise` are all preferred current APIs for data modeling and structural equality.

**Overall Recommendation:**
This pattern and its associated TypeScript example are production-ready for publication. The code excellently demonstrates structural equality with proper data modeling, clear comparisons between referential and structural equality, and current Effect-TS best practices.

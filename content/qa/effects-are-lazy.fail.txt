**Validation Result:** FAIL

**Detailed Findings:**

*   **Global Pattern Rules Adherence:**
    *   FAIL: The pattern violates the global rule "Leverage Effect's built-in structured logging." The code uses direct `console.log` calls on lines 3, 6, and 10 instead of using Effect's structured logging system with `Effect.log`.

*   **Pattern Adherence & Correctness:**
    *   PASS: The TypeScript code (`src/effects-are-lazy.ts`) correctly demonstrates the pattern described in the documentation (`published/effects-are-lazy.mdx`). The code effectively shows that Effects are lazy blueprints by demonstrating the execution order: definition, blueprint creation, and then actual execution only when `Effect.runSync` is called.

*   **Idiomatic Effect-TS Usage:**
    *   PARTIAL: While the code correctly uses `Effect.sync` and `Effect.runSync`, it violates Effect's principle of pure functional programming by using side-effectful `console.log` calls instead of Effect's structured logging system. This makes the code less testable and breaks the functional paradigm.

*   **Idiomatic TypeScript Usage:**
    *   PASS: Clean code structure with appropriate use of `const` declarations. The example is simple and focused on demonstrating the core concept of laziness.

*   **Effect API Adherence (MCP Server Check):**
    *   PASS: All Effect APIs used are current as per the API Manifest. `Effect.sync` and `Effect.runSync` are both preferred current APIs.

**Overall Recommendation:**
Requires revisions to replace all direct `console.log` calls with `Effect.log` to maintain consistency with Effect's structured logging principles and global coding rules. The core concept demonstration is correct but needs to follow Effect's functional programming paradigm.

**Validation Result:** FAIL

**Detailed Findings:**

*   **Global Pattern Rules Adherence:**
    *   FAIL: The pattern violates the global rule "Leverage Effect's built-in structured logging." The code uses direct `console.log` calls on lines 19 and 22 instead of using Effect's structured logging system with `Effect.log`. Additionally, it uses `.catch(console.error)` on line 26 instead of proper Effect error handling.

*   **Pattern Adherence & Correctness:**
    *   PASS: The TypeScript code (`src/beyond-the-date-type.ts`) correctly demonstrates the pattern described in the documentation (`published/beyond-the-date-type.mdx`). The code properly shows how to use `Clock.currentTimeMillis` instead of `Date.now()`, store timestamps as immutable primitives, and make time-based logic testable through the Clock service.

*   **Idiomatic Effect-TS Usage:**
    *   PARTIAL: While the code correctly uses `Clock.currentTimeMillis`, `Effect.gen`, `Effect.runPromise`, and `Effect.provideService`, it violates Effect's principle of pure functional programming by using side-effectful `console.log` calls and Promise-based `.catch()` instead of Effect's structured logging and error handling systems.

*   **Idiomatic TypeScript Usage:**
    *   PASS: Strong typing is maintained throughout with proper interface definitions and type imports. Clean naming conventions and appropriate use of `const` declarations. The Event interface properly uses readonly properties.

*   **Effect API Adherence (MCP Server Check):**
    *   PASS: All Effect APIs used are current as per the API Manifest. `Clock.currentTimeMillis`, `Effect.gen`, `Effect.runPromise`, `Effect.provideService`, and `Clock.make` are all preferred current APIs.

**Overall Recommendation:**
Requires revisions to replace all direct `console.log` calls with `Effect.log` and `.catch()` with proper Effect error handling to maintain consistency with Effect's structured logging principles and global coding rules. The Clock service usage pattern is correct but needs to follow Effect's functional programming paradigm.

# Use Effect.gen for Business Logic

## Guideline

Use `Effect.gen` to write your core business logic, especially when it involves
multiple sequential steps or conditional branching.

## Rationale

Generators provide a syntax that closely resembles standard synchronous code
(`async/await`), making complex workflows significantly easier to read, write,
and debug.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";

declare const validateUser: (data: any) => Effect.Effect<any>;
declare const hashPassword: (pw: string) => Effect.Effect<string>;
declare const dbCreateUser: (data: any) => Effect.Effect<any>;

const createUser = (userData: any) =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const validated = yield* validateUser(userData);
    const hashed = yield* hashPassword(validated.password);
    return yield* dbCreateUser({ ...validated, password: hashed });
  });
```

**Explanation:**  
`Effect.gen` allows you to express business logic in a clear, sequential style,
improving maintainability.

## Anti-Pattern

Using long chains of `.andThen` or `.flatMap` for multi-step business logic.
This is harder to read and pass state between steps.

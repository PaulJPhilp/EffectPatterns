# Avoid Long Chains of .andThen; Use Generators Instead

## Guideline

For sequential logic involving more than two steps, prefer `Effect.gen` over
chaining multiple `.andThen` or `.flatMap` calls.

## Rationale

`Effect.gen` provides a flat, linear code structure that is easier to read and
debug than deeply nested functional chains.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/avoid-long-andthen-chains.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
Generators keep sequential logic readable and easy to maintain.

## Anti-Pattern

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";
declare const step1: () => Effect.Effect<any>;
declare const step2: (a: any) => Effect.Effect<any>;

step1().pipe(Effect.flatMap((a) => step2(a))); // Or .andThen
```

Chaining many `.flatMap` or `.andThen` calls leads to deeply nested,
hard-to-read code.

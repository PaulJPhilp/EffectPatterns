## Guideline

To safely manage a resource that has an open/close lifecycle (like a file handle or database connection) for the duration of a stream, use the `Stream.acquireRelease` constructor.

---

## Rationale

What happens if a pipeline processing a file fails halfway through? In a naive implementation, the file handle might be left open, leading to a resource leak. Over time, these leaks can exhaust system resources and crash your application.

`Stream.acquireRelease` is Effect's robust solution to this problem. It's built on `Scope`, Effect's fundamental resource-management tool.

1.  **Guaranteed Cleanup**: You provide an `acquire` effect to open the resource and a `release` effect to close it. Effect guarantees that the `release` effect will be called when the stream terminates, for *any* reason: successful completion, a processing failure, or even external interruption.
2.  **Declarative and Co-located**: The logic for a resource's entire lifecycle—acquisition, usage (the stream itself), and release—is defined in one place. This makes the code easier to understand and reason about compared to manual `try/finally` blocks.
3.  **Prevents Resource Leaks**: It is the idiomatic way to build truly resilient pipelines that do not leak resources, which is essential for long-running, production-grade applications.
4.  **Composability**: The resulting stream is just a normal `Stream`, which can be composed with any other stream operators.

---

## Good Example

This example creates and writes to a temporary file. `Stream.acquireRelease` is used to acquire a readable stream from that file. The pipeline then processes the file but is designed to fail partway through. The logs demonstrate that the `release` effect (which deletes the file) is still executed, preventing any resource leaks.

```typescript
import { Effect, Stream } from 'effect';
import { NodeFileSystem } from '@effect/platform-node';
import * as path from 'node:path';
import * as fs from 'node:fs';

// The resource we want to manage: a file handle
const acquire = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const fs = yield* NodeFileSystem;
  const filePath = path.join(__dirname, 'temp-resource.txt');
  yield* fs.writeFileString(filePath, 'data 1\ndata 2\nFAIL\ndata 4');
  yield* Effect.log('Resource ACQUIRED: Opened file for reading.');
  return fs.createReadStream(filePath);
});

// The release function for our resource
const release = (stream: fs.ReadStream) =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const fs = yield* NodeFileSystem;
    const filePath = path.join(__dirname, 'temp-resource.txt');
    yield* fs.remove(filePath);
    yield* Effect.log('Resource RELEASED: Closed and deleted file.');
  });

// The stream that uses the acquired resource
const stream = Stream.acquireRelease(acquire, release).pipe(
  Stream.flatMap((readable) => Stream.fromReadable(() => readable)),
  Stream.decodeText('utf-8'),
  Stream.splitLines,
  Stream.tap((line) => Effect.log(`Processing: ${line}`)),
  // Introduce a failure to demonstrate release is still called
  Stream.mapEffect((line) =>
    line === 'FAIL' ? Effect.fail('Boom!') : Effect.succeed(line)
  )
);

// We expect this program to fail, but the release logic should still execute.
const program = Stream.runDrain(stream);

Effect.runPromiseExit(program).then((exit) => {
  if (exit._tag === 'Failure') {
    console.log('\nPipeline failed as expected, but resources were cleaned up.');
  }
});
/*
Output:
... level=INFO msg="Resource ACQUIRED: Opened file for reading."
... level=INFO msg="Processing: data 1"
... level=INFO msg="Processing: data 2"
... level=INFO msg="Processing: FAIL"
... level=INFO msg="Resource RELEASED: Closed and deleted file."

Pipeline failed as expected, but resources were cleaned up.
*/
```

## Anti-Pattern

The anti-pattern is to manage resources manually outside the stream's context. This is brittle and almost always leads to resource leaks when errors occur.

```typescript
import { Effect, Stream } from 'effect';
import { NodeFileSystem } from '@effect/platform-node';
import * as path from 'node:path';

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const fs = yield* NodeFileSystem;
  const filePath = path.join(__dirname, 'temp-resource-bad.txt');

  // 1. Resource acquired manually before the stream
  yield* fs.writeFileString(filePath, 'data 1\ndata 2');
  const readable = fs.createReadStream(filePath);
  yield* Effect.log('Resource acquired manually.');

  const stream = Stream.fromReadable(() => readable).pipe(
    Stream.decodeText('utf-8'),
    Stream.splitLines,
    // This stream will fail, causing the run to reject.
    Stream.map(() => {
      throw new Error('Something went wrong!');
    })
  );

  // 2. Stream is executed
  yield* Stream.runDrain(stream);

  // 3. This release logic is NEVER reached if the stream fails.
  yield* fs.remove(filePath);
  yield* Effect.log('Resource released manually. (This will not be logged)');
});

Effect.runPromiseExit(program).then((exit) => {
  if (exit._tag === 'Failure') {
    console.log('\nPipeline failed. The temp file was NOT deleted.');
  }
});
```

In this anti-pattern, the `fs.remove` call is unreachable because the `Stream.runDrain` effect fails, causing the `gen` block to terminate immediately. The temporary file is leaked onto the disk. `Stream.acquireRelease` solves this problem entirely.

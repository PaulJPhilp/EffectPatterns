# Manage Shared State Safely with `Ref`

## Guideline

Use the `Ref<A>` data type to model shared, mutable state in a concurrent environment.  
`Ref` provides atomic, thread-safe operations for reading and updating state in effectful programs.

## Rationale

Managing shared state with plain variables or objects is unsafe in concurrent or asynchronous code.  
`Ref` ensures all updates are atomic and free of race conditions, making your code robust and predictable.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Effect, Ref } from "effect";

// Create a Ref with an initial value
const makeCounter = Ref.make(0);

// Increment the counter atomically
const increment = makeCounter.pipe(
  Effect.flatMap((counter) =>
    Ref.update(counter, (n) => n + 1)
  )
);

// Read the current value
const getValue = makeCounter.pipe(
  Effect.flatMap((counter) => Ref.get(counter))
);

// Use Ref in a workflow
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const counter = yield* Ref.make(0);
  yield* Ref.update(counter, (n) => n + 1);
  const value = yield* Ref.get(counter);
  yield* Effect.log(`Counter value: ${value}`);
});
```

**Explanation:**  
- `Ref` is an atomic, mutable reference for effectful and concurrent code.
- All operations are safe, composable, and free of race conditions.
- Use `Ref` for counters, caches, or any shared mutable state.

## Anti-Pattern

Using plain variables or objects for shared state in concurrent or async code, which can lead to race conditions, bugs, and unpredictable behavior.

# Your First Stream
**Rule:** Use Stream to process sequences of data lazily and efficiently.

### Example
```typescript
import { Effect, Stream } from "effect"

// Create a stream from explicit values
const numbers = Stream.make(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

// Create a stream from an array
const fromArray = Stream.fromIterable([10, 20, 30])

// Create a single-value stream
const single = Stream.succeed("hello")

// Transform and run the stream
const program = numbers.pipe(
  Stream.map((n) => n * 2),           // Double each number
  Stream.filter((n) => n > 4),        // Keep only > 4
  Stream.runCollect                    // Collect results
)

Effect.runPromise(program).then((chunk) => {
  console.log([...chunk])  // [6, 8, 10]
})
```

**Explanation:**  
Streams are Effect's answer to processing sequences of data. Unlike arrays which hold all values in memory at once, streams produce values on demand. This makes them ideal for:

1. **Large datasets** - Process millions of records without loading everything into memory
2. **Async data** - Handle data that arrives over time (files, APIs, events)
3. **Composable pipelines** - Chain transformations that work element by element

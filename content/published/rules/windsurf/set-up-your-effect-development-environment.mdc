# Set Up Your Effect Development Environment
**Rule:** Install the Effect extension and configure TypeScript for optimal Effect development.

**Explanation:**  
A well-configured environment helps you:

1. **See types clearly** - Effect types can be complex
2. **Get better autocomplete** - Know what methods are available
3. **Catch errors early** - TypeScript finds problems
4. **Navigate easily** - Go to definitions, find references

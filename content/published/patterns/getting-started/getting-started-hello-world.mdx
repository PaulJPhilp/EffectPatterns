# Hello World: Your First Effect

## Guideline

Create your first Effect using `Effect.succeed` to wrap a value, then run it
with `Effect.runSync` to see the result.

## Rationale

Every journey starts with "Hello World". In Effect, you create computations
by describing what you want to happen, then you run them. This separation is
what makes Effect powerful.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";

// Step 1: Create an Effect that succeeds with a value
const helloWorld = Effect.succeed("Hello, Effect!");

// Step 2: Run the Effect and get the result
const result = Effect.runSync(helloWorld);

console.log(result); // "Hello, Effect!"
```

## Building Up

Now let's add a side effect with `Effect.log`:

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  yield* Effect.log("Starting my first Effect program...");
  const message = "Hello, Effect!";
  yield* Effect.log(`Message: ${message}`);
  return message;
});

Effect.runSync(program);
// Output:
// timestamp=... level=INFO message="Starting my first Effect program..."
// timestamp=... level=INFO message="Message: Hello, Effect!"
```

## Key Concepts

1. **Effect.succeed(value)** - Creates an Effect that always succeeds with the given value
2. **Effect.log(message)** - Creates an Effect that logs a message
3. **Effect.gen** - A way to write sequential Effects like async/await
4. **Effect.runSync** - Executes the Effect and returns the result

# Leverage Effect's Built-in Structured Logging

## Guideline

Use `Effect.log`, `Effect.logInfo`, `Effect.logError`, and related functions to add structured, context-aware logging to your Effect code.  
This enables you to capture important events, errors, and business information in a consistent and configurable way.

## Rationale

Structured logging makes it easier to search, filter, and analyze logs in production.  
Effectâ€™s logging functions are context-aware, meaning they automatically include relevant metadata and can be configured globally.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";

// Log a simple message
const program = Effect.log("Starting the application");

// Log at different levels
const info = Effect.logInfo("User signed in");
const error = Effect.logError("Failed to connect to database");

// Log with dynamic values
const userId = 42;
const logUser = Effect.logInfo(`Processing user: ${userId}`);

// Use logging in a workflow
const workflow = Effect.gen(function* () {
  yield* Effect.log("Beginning workflow");
  // ... do some work
  yield* Effect.logInfo("Workflow step completed");
  // ... handle errors
  yield* Effect.logError("Something went wrong");
});
```

**Explanation:**  
- `Effect.log` logs a message at the default level.
- `Effect.logInfo` and `Effect.logError` log at specific levels.
- Logging is context-aware and can be used anywhere in your Effect workflows.

## Anti-Pattern

Using `console.log` or ad-hoc logging scattered throughout your code, which is not structured, not context-aware, and harder to manage in production.

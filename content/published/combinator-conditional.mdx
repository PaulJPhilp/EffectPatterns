# Conditional Branching with `if`, `when`, and `cond`

## Guideline

Use combinators like `if`, `when`, and `cond` to express conditional logic in a declarative, composable way.  
These combinators allow you to branch computations based on runtime conditions, without resorting to imperative `if` statements.

## Rationale

Declarative branching keeps your code composable, testable, and easy to reason about.  
It also ensures that error handling and context propagation are preserved, and that your code remains consistent across different Effect types.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Effect, Stream, Option, Either } from "effect";

// Effect: Branch based on a condition
const effect = Effect.if(true, {
  onTrue: () => Effect.succeed("yes"),
  onFalse: () => Effect.succeed("no")
}); // Effect<string>

// Option: Conditionally create an Option
const option = true ? Option.some("yes") : Option.none(); // Option<string> (Some("yes"))

// Either: Conditionally create an Either
const either = true
  ? Either.right("yes")
  : Either.left("error"); // Either<string, string> (Right("yes"))

// Stream: Conditionally emit a stream
const stream = false
  ? Stream.fromIterable([1, 2])
  : Stream.empty; // Stream<number> (empty)
```

**Explanation:**  
These combinators let you branch your computation based on a boolean or predicate, without leaving the world of composable, type-safe code.  
You can also use `when` to run an effect only if a condition is true, or `unless` to run it only if a condition is false.

## Anti-Pattern

Using imperative `if` statements to decide which effect, option, either, or stream to return, breaking composability and making error/context handling less predictable.

# Mapping and Chaining over Collections with `forEach` and `all`

## Guideline

Use the `forEach` and `all` combinators to apply an effectful function to every item in a collection and combine the results.  
This enables you to process lists, arrays, or other collections in a type-safe, composable, and often parallel way.

## Rationale

Batch and parallel processing are common in real-world applications.  
These combinators let you express "do this for every item" declaratively, without manual loops or imperative control flow, and they preserve error handling and context propagation.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Effect, Either, Option, Stream } from "effect";

// Effect: Apply an effectful function to each item in an array
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const effect = Effect.forEach(numbers, (n) => Effect.succeed(n * 2));
// Effect<number[]>

// Effect: Run multiple effects in parallel and collect results
const effects = [Effect.succeed(1), Effect.succeed(2)];
const allEffect = Effect.all(effects, { concurrency: "unbounded" }); // Effect<[1, 2]>

// Option: Map over a collection of options and collect only the Some values
const options = [Option.some(1), Option.none(), Option.some(3)];
const filtered = options.filter(Option.isSome).map((o) => o.value); // [1, 3]

// Either: Collect all Right values from a collection of Eithers
const eithers = [Either.right(1), Either.left("fail"), Either.right(3)];
const rights = eithers.filter(Either.isRight); // [Either.Right(1), Either.Right(3)]

// Stream: Map and flatten a stream of arrays
const stream = Stream.fromIterable([
  [1, 2],
  [3, 4],
]).pipe(Stream.flatMap((arr) => Stream.fromIterable(arr))); // Stream<number>

```

**Explanation:**  
`forEach` and `all` let you process collections in a way that is composable, type-safe, and often parallel.  
They handle errors and context automatically, and can be used for batch jobs, parallel requests, or data transformations.

## Anti-Pattern

Using manual loops (`for`, `forEach`, etc.) with side effects, or collecting results imperatively, which breaks composability and loses error/context handling.

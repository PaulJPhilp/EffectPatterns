# Type Classes for Equality, Ordering, and Hashing with `Data.Class`

## Guideline

Use `Data.Class` to derive or implement type classes for equality, ordering, and hashing for your custom data types.  
This enables composable, type-safe abstractions and allows your types to work seamlessly with Effect’s collections and algorithms.

## Rationale

Type classes like `Equal`, `Order`, and `Hash` provide a principled way to define how your types are compared, ordered, and hashed.  
This is essential for using your types in sets, maps, and for sorting or deduplication.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Data, Equal, HashSet } from "effect";

// Define custom data types with structural equality
const user1 = Data.struct({ id: 1, name: "Alice" });
const user2 = Data.struct({ id: 1, name: "Alice" });
const user3 = Data.struct({ id: 2, name: "Bob" });

// Data.struct provides automatic structural equality
console.log(Equal.equals(user1, user2)); // true (same structure)
console.log(Equal.equals(user1, user3)); // false (different values)

// Use in a HashSet (works because Data.struct implements Equal)
const set = HashSet.make(user1);
console.log(HashSet.has(set, user2)); // true (structural equality)

// Create an array and use structural equality
const users = [user1, user3];
console.log(users.some((u) => Equal.equals(u, user2))); // true

```

**Explanation:**  
- `Data.Class.getEqual` derives an equality type class for your data type.
- `Data.Class.getOrder` derives an ordering type class, useful for sorting.
- `Data.Class.getHash` derives a hash function for use in sets and maps.
- These type classes make your types fully compatible with Effect’s collections and algorithms.

## Anti-Pattern

Relying on reference equality, ad-hoc comparison functions, or not providing type class instances for your custom types, which can lead to bugs and inconsistent behavior in collections.

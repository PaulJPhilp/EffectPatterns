# Comparing Data by Value with `Data.struct`

## Guideline

Use `Data.struct` to create immutable, structurally-typed objects whose equality is based on their contents, not their reference.  
This enables safe, predictable comparisons and is ideal for domain modeling.

## Rationale

JavaScript objects are compared by reference, which can lead to subtle bugs when modeling value objects.  
`Data.struct` ensures that two objects with the same contents are considered equal, supporting value-based logic and collections.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Data, Equal } from "effect";

// Create two structurally equal objects
const user1 = Data.struct({ id: 1, name: "Alice" });
const user2 = Data.struct({ id: 1, name: "Alice" });

// Compare by value, not reference
const areEqual = Equal.equals(user1, user2); // true

// Use in a HashSet or as keys in a Map
import { HashSet } from "effect";
const set = HashSet.make(user1);
console.log(HashSet.has(set, user2)); // true
```

**Explanation:**  
- `Data.struct` creates immutable objects with value-based equality.
- Use for domain entities, value objects, and when storing objects in sets or as map keys.
- Avoids bugs from reference-based comparison.

## Anti-Pattern

Using plain JavaScript objects for value-based logic, which compares by reference and can lead to incorrect equality checks and collection behavior.

# Work with Immutable Sets using `HashSet`

## Guideline

Use the `HashSet<A>` data type to represent sets of unique values with efficient, immutable operations.  
`HashSet` is ideal for membership checks, set algebra, and modeling collections where uniqueness matters.

## Rationale

`HashSet` provides high-performance, immutable set operations that are safe for concurrent and functional programming.  
It avoids the pitfalls of mutable JavaScript `Set` and is optimized for use in Effect workflows.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { HashSet } from "effect";

// Create a HashSet from an array
const setA = HashSet.fromIterable([1, 2, 3]);
const setB = HashSet.fromIterable([3, 4, 5]);

// Membership check
const hasTwo = HashSet.has(setA, 2); // true

// Union, intersection, difference
const union = HashSet.union(setA, setB);         // HashSet {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
const intersection = HashSet.intersection(setA, setB); // HashSet {3}
const difference = HashSet.difference(setA, setB);     // HashSet {1, 2}

// Add and remove elements
const withSix = HashSet.add(setA, 6);    // HashSet {1, 2, 3, 6}
const withoutOne = HashSet.remove(setA, 1); // HashSet {2, 3}
```

**Explanation:**  
- `HashSet` is immutable and supports efficient set operations.
- Use it for membership checks, set algebra, and modeling unique collections.
- Safe for concurrent and functional workflows.

## Anti-Pattern

Using mutable JavaScript `Set` for shared or concurrent data, or for set operations in functional code, which can lead to bugs and unpredictable behavior.

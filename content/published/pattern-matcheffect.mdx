# Effectful Pattern Matching with `matchEffect`

## Guideline

Use the `matchEffect` combinator to perform effectful branching based on whether an Effect succeeds or fails.  
This allows you to run different Effects for each case, enabling rich, composable workflows.

## Rationale

Sometimes, handling a success or failure requires running additional Effects (e.g., logging, retries, cleanup).  
`matchEffect` lets you do this declaratively, keeping your code composable and type-safe.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";

// Effect: Run different Effects on success or failure
const effect = Effect.fail("Oops!").pipe(
  Effect.matchEffect({
    onFailure: (err) => Effect.logError(`Error: ${err}`),
    onSuccess: (value) => Effect.log(`Success: ${value}`),
  })
); // Effect<void>
```

**Explanation:**  
- `matchEffect` allows you to run an Effect for both the success and failure cases.
- This is useful for logging, cleanup, retries, or any effectful side effect that depends on the outcome.

## Anti-Pattern

Using `match` to return values and then wrapping them in Effects, or duplicating logic for side effects, instead of using `matchEffect` for direct effectful branching.

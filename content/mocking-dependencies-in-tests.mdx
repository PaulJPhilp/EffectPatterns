## Guideline

To test a piece of code in isolation, identify its service dependencies and provide mock implementations for them using a test-specific `Layer`. The most common way to create a mock layer is with `Layer.succeed(ServiceTag, mockImplementation)`.

---

## Rationale

The primary goal of a unit test is to verify the logic of a single unit of code, independent of its external dependencies. Effect's dependency injection system is designed to make this easy and type-safe.

By providing a mock `Layer` in your test, you replace a real dependency (like an `HttpClient` that makes network calls) with a fake one that returns predictable data. This provides several key benefits:
-   **Determinism:** Your tests always produce the same result, free from the flakiness of network or database connections.
-   **Speed:** Tests run instantly without waiting for slow I/O operations.
-   **Type Safety:** The TypeScript compiler ensures your mock implementation perfectly matches the real service's interface, preventing your tests from becoming outdated.
-   **Explicitness:** The test setup clearly documents all the dependencies required for the code to run.

## Good Example

We want to test a `Notifier` service that uses an `EmailClient` to send emails. In our test, we provide a mock `EmailClient` that doesn't actually send emails but just returns a success value.

## Anti-Pattern

Testing your business logic using the "live" implementation of its dependencies. This creates an integration test, not a unit test. It will be slow, unreliable, and may have real-world side effects (like actually sending an email).

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";
import { NotifierLive } from "./somewhere";
import { EmailClientLive } from "./somewhere"; // The REAL email client

// ❌ WRONG: This test will try to send a real email.
it("sends a real email", () =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const notifier = yield* Notifier;
    yield* notifier.notifyUser(123, "This is a test email!");
  }).pipe(
    Effect.provide(NotifierLive),
    Effect.provide(EmailClientLive), // Using the live layer makes this an integration test
    Effect.runPromise,
  ));
```

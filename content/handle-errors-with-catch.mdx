# Handle Errors with catchTag, catchTags, and catchAll

## Guideline

To recover from failures, use the `catch*` family of functions.
`Effect.catchTag` for specific tagged errors, `Effect.catchTags` for multiple,
and `Effect.catchAll` for any error.

## Rationale

Effect's structured error handling allows you to build resilient applications.
By using tagged errors and `catchTag`, you can handle different failure
scenarios with different logic in a type-safe way.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Data, Effect } from "effect";

class FooError extends Data.TaggedError("FooError") {}

const program: Effect.Effect<string, FooError> = Effect.fail(new FooError());

const handled = program.pipe(
  Effect.catchTag("FooError", (error) => Effect.succeed("Caught a Foo!")),
);
```

**Explanation:**  
Use `catchTag` to handle specific error types in a type-safe, composable way.

## Anti-Pattern

Using `try/catch` blocks inside your Effect compositions. It breaks the
declarative flow and bypasses Effect's powerful, type-safe error channels.

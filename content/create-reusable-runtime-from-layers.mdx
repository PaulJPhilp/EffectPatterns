# Create a Reusable Runtime from Layers

## Guideline

For applications that need to run multiple effects (e.g., a web server), use
`Layer.toRuntime(appLayer)` to compile your dependency graph into a single,
reusable `Runtime` object.

## Rationale

Building the dependency graph from layers has a one-time cost. Creating a
`Runtime` once when your application starts is highly efficient for
long-running applications.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/create-reusable-runtime-from-layers.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
By compiling your layers into a Runtime once, you avoid rebuilding the
dependency graph for every effect execution.

## Anti-Pattern

For a long-running application, avoid providing layers and running an effect
in a single operation. This forces Effect to rebuild the dependency graph on
every execution.

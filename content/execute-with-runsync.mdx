# Execute Synchronous Effects with Effect.runSync

## Guideline

To execute an `Effect` that is guaranteed to be synchronous, use
`Effect.runSync`. This will return the success value directly or throw the
error.

## Rationale

`Effect.runSync` is an optimized runner for Effects that don't involve any
asynchronous operations. If the Effect contains any async operations,
`runSync` will throw an error.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";

const program = Effect.succeed(10).pipe(Effect.map((n) => n * 2));

const result = Effect.runSync(program); // result is 20
```

**Explanation:**  
Use `runSync` only for Effects that are fully synchronous. If the Effect
contains async code, use `runPromise` instead.

## Anti-Pattern

Do not use `runSync` on an Effect that contains asynchronous operations like
`Effect.delay` or `Effect.promise`. This will result in a runtime error.

## Guideline

To enable communication between independent, concurrent fibers, use one of Effect's specialized data structures:
-   **``Queue<A>``**: For distributing work items. Each item put on the queue is taken and processed by only **one** consumer.
-   **``PubSub<A>``**: For broadcasting events. Each message published is delivered to **every** subscriber.

---

## Rationale

Directly calling functions between different logical parts of a concurrent application creates tight coupling, making the system brittle and hard to scale. `Queue` and `PubSub` solve this by acting as asynchronous, fiber-safe message brokers.

This decouples the **producer** of a message from its **consumer(s)**. The producer doesn't need to know who is listening, or how many listeners there are. This allows you to build resilient, scalable systems where you can add or remove workers/listeners without changing the producer's code.

Furthermore, bounded `Queue`s and `PubSub`s provide automatic **back-pressure**. If consumers can't keep up, the producer will automatically pause before adding new items, preventing your system from becoming overloaded.

## Good Example 1: `Queue` for a Work Pool

A producer fiber adds jobs to a `Queue`, and a worker fiber takes jobs off the queue to process them.

```typescript
import { Effect, Queue } from "effect";

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  // Create a bounded queue that can hold a maximum of 10 items.
  const queue = yield* Queue.bounded<string>(10);

  // Producer Fiber: Add a job to the queue every second.
  const producer = Effect.gen(function* () {
    let i = 0;
    while (true) {
      yield* Queue.offer(queue, `job-${i++}`);
      yield* Effect.sleep("1 second");
    }
  }).pipe(Effect.fork);

  // Worker Fiber: Take a job from the queue and process it.
  const worker = Effect.gen(function* () {
    while (true) {
      const job = yield* Queue.take(queue);
      yield* Effect.log(`Processing ${job}...`);
      yield* Effect.sleep("2 seconds"); // Simulate work
    }
  }).pipe(Effect.fork);

  // Let them run for a while...
  yield* Effect.sleep("10 seconds");
});
```

## Good Example 2: `PubSub` for Event Broadcasting

A publisher sends an event, and multiple subscribers react to it independently.

```typescript
import { Effect, PubSub } from "effect";

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const pubsub = yield* PubSub.bounded<string>(10);

  // Subscriber 1: The "Audit" service
  const auditSub = PubSub.subscribe(pubsub).pipe(
    Effect.flatMap((subscription) =>
      Effect.gen(function* () {
        while (true) {
          const event = yield* Queue.take(subscription);
          yield* Effect.log(`AUDIT: Received event: ${event}`);
        }
      }),
    ),
    Effect.fork,
  );

  // Subscriber 2: The "Notifier" service
  const notifierSub = PubSub.subscribe(pubsub).pipe(
    Effect.flatMap((subscription) =>
      Effect.gen(function* () {
        while (true) {
          const event = yield* Queue.take(subscription);
          yield* Effect.log(`NOTIFIER: Sending notification for: ${event}`);
        }
      }),
    ),
    Effect.fork,
  );

  // Give subscribers time to start
  yield* Effect.sleep("1 second");

  // Publisher: Publish an event that both subscribers will receive.
  yield* PubSub.publish(pubsub, "user_logged_in");
});
```

## Anti-Pattern

Simulating a queue with a simple `Ref<A[]>`. This approach is inefficient due to polling and is not safe from race conditions without manual, complex locking mechanisms. It also lacks critical features like back-pressure.

```typescript
import { Effect, Ref } from "effect";

// ‚ùå WRONG: This is inefficient and prone to race conditions.
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const queueRef = yield* Ref.make<string[]>([]);

  // Producer adds to the array
  const producer = Ref.update(queueRef, (q) => [...q, "new_item"]);

  // Consumer has to constantly poll the array to see if it's empty.
  const consumer = Ref.get(queueRef).pipe(
    Effect.flatMap((q) =>
      q.length > 0
        ? Ref.set(queueRef, q.slice(1)).pipe(Effect.as(q[0]))
        : Effect.sleep("1 second").pipe(Effect.flatMap(() => consumer)), // Inefficient polling
    ),
  );
});
```

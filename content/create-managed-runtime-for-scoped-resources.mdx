# Create a Managed Runtime for Scoped Resources

## Guideline

For services that manage resources needing explicit cleanup (e.g., a database
connection), define them in a `Layer` using `Layer.scoped`. Then, use
`Layer.launch` to provide this layer to your application.

## Rationale

`Layer.launch` is designed for resource safety. It acquires all resources,
provides them to your effect, and—crucially—guarantees that all registered
finalizers are executed upon completion or interruption.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Effect, Layer } from "effect";

class DatabasePool extends Effect.Tag("DbPool")<DatabasePool, any> {}

const DatabaseLive = Layer.scoped(
  DatabasePool,
  Effect.acquireRelease(
    Effect.log("Acquiring pool"),
    () => Effect.log("Releasing pool"),
  ),
);

const launchedApp = Layer.launch(
  Effect.provide(Effect.log("Using DB"), DatabaseLive)
);

Effect.runPromise(launchedApp);
```

**Explanation:**  
`Layer.launch` ensures that resources are acquired and released safely, even
in the event of errors or interruptions.

## Anti-Pattern

Do not use `Layer.toRuntime` with layers that contain scoped resources. This
will acquire the resource, but the runtime has no mechanism to release it,
leading to resource leaks.

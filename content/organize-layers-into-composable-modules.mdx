## Guideline

For large applications, avoid a single, flat list of services. Instead, structure your application by creating hierarchical layers:
1.  **`BaseLayer`**: Provides application-wide infrastructure (Logger, Config, Database).
2.  **`FeatureModule` Layers**: Provide the services for a specific business domain (e.g., `UserModule`, `ProductModule`). These depend on the `BaseLayer`.
3.  **`AppLayer`**: The top-level layer that composes the feature modules by providing them with the `BaseLayer`.

---

## Rationale

As an application grows, a flat composition strategy where all services are merged into one giant layer becomes unwieldy and hard to reason about. The Composable Modules pattern solves this by introducing structure.

This approach creates a clean, scalable, and highly testable architecture where complexity is contained within each module. The top-level composition becomes a clear, high-level diagram of your application's architecture, and feature modules can be tested in isolation by providing them with a mocked `BaseLayer`.

---

## Good Example

This example shows a `BaseLayer` with a `Logger`, a `UserModule` that uses the `Logger`, and a final `AppLayer` that wires them together.

### 1. The Base Infrastructure Layer

```typescript
// src/core/Logger.ts
import { Console, Effect } from "effect";

export class Logger extends Effect.Tag("App/Logger")<Logger, {
  readonly log: (message: string) => Effect.Effect<void>;
}>() {}

export const LoggerLive = Logger.toLayer(
  Effect.sync(() => Logger.of({ log: (msg) => Console.log(`[INFO] ${msg}`) })),
);

// src/core/index.ts
import { Layer } from "effect";
import { LoggerLive } from "./Logger";

// The BaseLayer merges all core, cross-cutting services.
export const BaseLayer = Layer.mergeAll(LoggerLive);
```

### 2. The Feature Module Layer

```typescript
// src/features/User/UserRepository.ts
import { Effect, Layer } from "effect";
import { Logger } from "../../core/Logger";

export class UserRepository extends Effect.Tag("App/User/UserRepository")<UserRepository, any>() {}

export const UserRepositoryLive = UserRepository.toLayer(
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const logger = yield* Logger; // <-- Dependency on a base service
    return UserRepository.of({
      findById: (id: number) => logger.log(`Finding user ${id}`),
    });
  }),
);

// src/features/User/index.ts
import { Layer } from "effect";
import { UserRepositoryLive } from "./UserRepository";
// ... other user services would be merged here

// The UserModule provides all services for the User domain.
// It exposes its own dependencies (like Logger) in its requirements.
export const UserModuleLive = Layer.mergeAll(UserRepositoryLive);
```

### 3. The Final Application Composition

```typescript
// src/layers.ts
import { Layer } from "effect";
import { BaseLayer } from "./core";
import { UserModuleLive } from "./features/User";
// import { ProductModuleLive } from "./features/Product";

const AllModules = Layer.mergeAll(UserModuleLive /*, ProductModuleLive */);

// Provide the BaseLayer to all modules at once, creating a self-contained AppLayer.
export const AppLayer = Layer.provide(AllModules, BaseLayer);
```

## Anti-Pattern

A flat composition strategy for a large application. While simple at first, it quickly becomes difficult to manage.

```typescript
// ‚ùå This file becomes huge and hard to navigate in a large project.
const AppLayer = Layer.mergeAll(
  LoggerLive,
  ConfigLive,
  DatabaseLive,
  TracerLive,
  UserServiceLive,
  UserRepositoryLive,
  ProductServiceLive,
  ProductRepositoryLive,
  BillingServiceLive,
  // ...and 50 other services
);
```

## Guideline

When a computation can fail (e.g., a network error) or succeed but find nothing, model its return type as ``Effect<Option<A>>``. This separates the "hard failure" channel from the "soft failure" (or empty) channel.

---

## Rationale

This pattern provides a precise way to handle three distinct outcomes of an operation:

1.  **Success with a value:** `Effect.succeed(Option.some(value))`
2.  **Success with no value:** `Effect.succeed(Option.none())` (e.g., user not found)
3.  **Failure:** `Effect.fail(new DatabaseError())` (e.g., database connection lost)

By using `Option` inside the success channel of an `Effect`, you keep the error channel clean for true, unexpected, or unrecoverable errors. The "not found" case is often an expected and recoverable part of your business logic, and `Option.none()` models this perfectly.

---

## Good Example

This function to find a user can fail if the database is down, or it can succeed but find no user. The return type ``Effect.Effect<Option.Option<User>, DatabaseError>`` makes this contract perfectly clear.

`<Example path="./src/distinguish-not-found-from-errors.ts" />`

## Anti-Pattern

A common alternative is to create a specific NotFoundError and put it in the error channel alongside other errors.

````typescript
class NotFoundError extends Data.TaggedError("NotFoundError") {}
	
	// ❌ This signature conflates two different kinds of failure.
	const findUserUnsafely = (
	  id: number,
	): Effect.Effect<User, DatabaseError | NotFoundError> => {
	  // ...
	  return Effect.fail(new NotFoundError());
	};
````

While this works, it can be less expressive. It treats a "not found" result—which might be a normal part of your application's flow—the same as a catastrophic DatabaseError. 

Using ````Effect<Option<A>>```` often leads to clearer and more precise business logic.

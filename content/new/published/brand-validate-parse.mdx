# Validating and Parsing Branded Types

## Guideline

Use `Schema` in combination with `Brand` to validate and parse branded types at runtime.  
This ensures that only values passing your validation logic can be constructed as branded types, making your domain models robust and type-safe.

## Rationale

While branding types at the type level prevents accidental misuse, runtime validation is needed to ensure only valid values are constructed from user input, APIs, or external sources.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Brand, Effect, Schema } from "effect";

// Define a branded type for Email
type Email = string & Brand.Brand<"Email">;

// Create a Schema for Email validation
const EmailSchema = Schema.String.pipe(
  Schema.pattern(/^[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+$/), // Simple email regex
  Schema.brand("Email" as const) // Attach the brand
);

// Parse and validate an email at runtime
const parseEmail = (input: string) =>
  Effect.try({
    try: () => Schema.decodeSync(EmailSchema)(input),
    catch: (err) => `Invalid email: ${String(err)}`,
  });

// Usage
parseEmail("user@example.com").pipe(
  Effect.match({
    onSuccess: (email) => console.log("Valid email:", email),
    onFailure: (err) => console.error(err),
  })
);

```

**Explanation:**  
- `Schema` is used to define validation logic for the branded type.
- `Brand.schema<Email>()` attaches the brand to the schema, so only validated values can be constructed as `Email`.
- This pattern ensures both compile-time and runtime safety.

## Anti-Pattern

Branding values without runtime validation, or accepting unvalidated user input as branded types, which can lead to invalid domain values and runtime bugs.

# Use `Chunk` for High-Performance Collections

## Guideline

Use the `Chunk<A>` data type as an immutable, high-performance alternative to JavaScript's `Array`.  
`Chunk` is optimized for functional programming, batch processing, and streaming scenarios.

## Rationale

`Chunk` provides efficient, immutable operations for large or frequently transformed collections.  
It avoids the pitfalls of mutable arrays and is designed for use in concurrent and streaming workflows.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Chunk } from "effect";

// Create a Chunk from an array
const numbers = Chunk.fromIterable([1, 2, 3, 4]); // Chunk<number>

// Map and filter over a Chunk
const doubled = Chunk.map(numbers, (n) => n * 2); // Chunk<number>
const evens = Chunk.filter(numbers, (n) => n % 2 === 0); // Chunk<number>

// Concatenate Chunks
const moreNumbers = Chunk.fromIterable([5, 6]);
const allNumbers = Chunk.appendAll(numbers, moreNumbers); // Chunk<number>

// Convert back to array
const arr = Chunk.toArray(allNumbers); // number[]
```

**Explanation:**  
- `Chunk` is immutable and optimized for performance.
- It supports efficient batch operations, concatenation, and transformation.
- Use `Chunk` in data pipelines, streaming, and concurrent scenarios.

## Anti-Pattern

Using mutable JavaScript arrays for shared or concurrent data, or for large-scale data processing, which can lead to bugs, inefficiency, and unpredictable behavior.

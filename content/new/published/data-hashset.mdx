# Work with Immutable Sets using `HashSet`

## Guideline

Use the `HashSet<A>` data type to represent sets of unique values with efficient, immutable operations.  
`HashSet` is ideal for membership checks, set algebra, and modeling collections where uniqueness matters.

## Rationale

`HashSet` provides high-performance, immutable set operations that are safe for concurrent and functional programming.  
It avoids the pitfalls of mutable JavaScript `Set` and is optimized for use in Effect workflows.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { HashSet, Effect } from "effect";

const setA = HashSet.fromIterable([1, 2, 3]);
const setB = HashSet.fromIterable([3, 4, 5]);
const hasTwo = HashSet.has(setA, 2);
const union = HashSet.union(setA, setB);
const intersection = HashSet.intersection(setA, setB);
const difference = HashSet.difference(setA, setB);
const withSix = HashSet.add(setA, 6);
const withoutOne = HashSet.remove(setA, 1);

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  yield* Effect.log(`setA: [${Array.from(setA).join(", ")}]`);
  yield* Effect.log(`setB: [${Array.from(setB).join(", ")}]`);
  yield* Effect.log(`setA has 2: ${hasTwo}`);
  yield* Effect.log(`union: [${Array.from(union).join(", ")}]`);
  yield* Effect.log(`intersection: [${Array.from(intersection).join(", ")}]`);
  yield* Effect.log(
    `difference (setA - setB): [${Array.from(difference).join(", ")}]`
  );
  yield* Effect.log(`withSix: [${Array.from(withSix).join(", ")}]`);
  yield* Effect.log(`withoutOne: [${Array.from(withoutOne).join(", ")}]`);
});

Effect.runPromise(program);

```

**Explanation:**  
- `HashSet` is immutable and supports efficient set operations.
- Use it for membership checks, set algebra, and modeling unique collections.
- Safe for concurrent and functional workflows.

## Anti-Pattern

Using mutable JavaScript `Set` for shared or concurrent data, or for set operations in functional code, which can lead to bugs and unpredictable behavior.

# Work with Dates and Times using `DateTime`

## Guideline

Use the `DateTime` data type to represent and manipulate dates and times in a type-safe, immutable, and time-zone-aware way.  
This enables safe, precise, and reliable time calculations in your applications.

## Rationale

JavaScript's native `Date` is mutable, not time-zone-aware, and can be error-prone.  
`DateTime` provides an immutable, functional alternative with explicit time zone handling and robust APIs for time arithmetic.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { DateTime, Duration, Effect } from "effect";

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const now = yield* DateTime.now;
  const parsed = DateTime.unsafeMake(Date.parse("2024-07-19T12:34:56Z"));
  const inOneHour = now.pipe(DateTime.add({ hours: 1 }));
  const oneHourAgo = now.pipe(DateTime.subtract({ hours: 1 }));
  const iso = DateTime.format()(now);
  const isBefore = oneHourAgo.epochMillis < now.epochMillis;
  yield* Effect.log(`now: ${DateTime.format()(now)}`);
  yield* Effect.log(`parsed: ${DateTime.format()(parsed)}`);
  yield* Effect.log(`inOneHour: ${DateTime.format()(inOneHour)}`);
  yield* Effect.log(`oneHourAgo: ${DateTime.format()(oneHourAgo)}`);
  yield* Effect.log(`isBefore: ${isBefore}`);
});

Effect.runPromise(program);

```

**Explanation:**  
- `DateTime` is immutable and time-zone-aware.
- Supports parsing, formatting, arithmetic, and comparison.
- Use for all date/time logic to avoid bugs with native `Date`.

## Anti-Pattern

Using JavaScript's mutable `Date` for time calculations, or ignoring time zones, which can lead to subtle and hard-to-debug errors.

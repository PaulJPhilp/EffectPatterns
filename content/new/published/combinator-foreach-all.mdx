# Mapping and Chaining over Collections with `forEach` and `all`

## Guideline

Use the `forEach` and `all` combinators to apply an effectful function to every item in a collection and combine the results.  
This enables you to process lists, arrays, or other collections in a type-safe, composable, and often parallel way.

## Rationale

Batch and parallel processing are common in real-world applications.  
These combinators let you express "do this for every item" declaratively, without manual loops or imperative control flow, and they preserve error handling and context propagation.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Effect, Stream, Option, Either } from "effect";

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const effect = Effect.forEach(numbers, (n) => Effect.succeed(n * 2));

const effects = [Effect.succeed(1), Effect.succeed(2)];
const allEffect = Effect.all(effects);

const options = [Option.some(1), Option.none(), Option.some(3)];
const filtered = options.filter(Option.isSome).map((o) => o.value);

const eithers = [Either.right(1), Either.left("fail"), Either.right(3)];
const rights = eithers.filter(Either.isRight).map((e) => e.right);

const stream = Stream.fromIterable([
  [1, 2],
  [3, 4],
]).pipe(Stream.flatMap((arr) => Stream.fromIterable(arr)));

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const effectResult = yield* effect;
  yield* Effect.log(`Effect.forEach result: [${effectResult.join(", ")}]`);
  const allResult = yield* allEffect;
  yield* Effect.log(`Effect.all result: [${allResult.join(", ")}]`);
  yield* Effect.log(`Option collection result: [${filtered.join(", ")}]`);
  yield* Effect.log(`Either collection result: [${rights.join(", ")}]`);
  const streamValues: number[] = [];
  yield* Stream.runForEach(stream, (n) =>
    Effect.sync(() => streamValues.push(n))
  );
  yield* Effect.log(`Stream.flatMap result: [${streamValues.join(", ")}]`);
});

Effect.runPromise(program);

```

**Explanation:**  
`forEach` and `all` let you process collections in a way that is composable, type-safe, and often parallel.  
They handle errors and context automatically, and can be used for batch jobs, parallel requests, or data transformations.

## Anti-Pattern

Using manual loops (`for`, `forEach`, etc.) with side effects, or collecting results imperatively, which breaks composability and loses error/context handling.

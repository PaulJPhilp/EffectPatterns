# Work with Arbitrary-Precision Integers using `bigint`

## Guideline

Use the built-in `bigint` type for integers that may exceed the safe range of JavaScript's `number` type (`Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`).  
This is especially important for domains like cryptography, distributed systems, or any application dealing with very large integer values.

## Rationale

JavaScript's `number` type cannot safely represent integers larger than 2^53 - 1.  
`bigint` provides true arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic, ensuring correctness for large values.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/data-bigint.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
- Use the `n` suffix to create `bigint` literals.
- All standard arithmetic operators work with `bigint`.
- Use `bigint` for IDs, counters, or calculations where precision and range are critical.

## Anti-Pattern

Using JavaScript's native `number` type for large integers, which can lead to precision loss and subtle bugs.

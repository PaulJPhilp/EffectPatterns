# Checking Option and Either Cases

## Guideline

Use the `isSome`, `isNone`, `isLeft`, and `isRight` predicates to check the case of an `Option` or `Either` for simple, type-safe branching.  
These are useful when you need to perform quick checks or filter collections based on presence or success.

## Rationale

These predicates provide a concise, type-safe way to check which case you have, without resorting to manual property checks or unsafe type assertions.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/pattern-option-either-checks.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
- `Option.isSome` and `Option.isNone` let you check for presence or absence.
- `Either.isRight` and `Either.isLeft` let you check for success or failure.
- These are especially useful for filtering or quick conditional logic.

## Anti-Pattern

Manually checking internal tags or properties (e.g., `option._tag === "Some"`), or using unsafe type assertions, which is less safe and less readable than using the provided predicates.

# Leverage Effect's Built-in Structured Logging

## Guideline

Use `Effect.log`, `Effect.logInfo`, `Effect.logError`, and related functions to add structured, context-aware logging to your Effect code.  
This enables you to capture important events, errors, and business information in a consistent and configurable way.

## Rationale

Structured logging makes it easier to search, filter, and analyze logs in production.  
Effectâ€™s logging functions are context-aware, meaning they automatically include relevant metadata and can be configured globally.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/observability-structured-logging.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
- `Effect.log` logs a message at the default level.
- `Effect.logInfo` and `Effect.logError` log at specific levels.
- Logging is context-aware and can be used anywhere in your Effect workflows.

## Anti-Pattern

Using `console.log` or ad-hoc logging scattered throughout your code, which is not structured, not context-aware, and harder to manage in production.

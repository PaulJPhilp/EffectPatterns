# Handle Unexpected Errors by Inspecting the `Cause`

## Guideline

Use the `Cause<E>` data type to get rich, structured information about errors and failures in your Effects.  
`Cause` captures not just expected errors, but also defects (unhandled exceptions), interruptions, and error traces.

## Rationale

Traditional error handling often loses information about *why* a failure occurred.  
`Cause` preserves the full error context, enabling advanced debugging, error reporting, and robust recovery strategies.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/data-cause.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
- `Cause` distinguishes between expected errors (`fail`), defects (`die`), and interruptions.
- Use `Cause.pretty` for human-readable error traces.
- Enables advanced error handling and debugging.
- Be sure to run the handled effect (e.g., with `Effect.runPromise(handled)`) to observe the error handling in action.

## Anti-Pattern

Catching only expected errors and ignoring defects or interruptions, which can lead to silent failures, missed bugs, and harder debugging.

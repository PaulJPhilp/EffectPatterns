# Handling Specific Errors with `catchTag` and `catchTags`

## Guideline

Use the `catchTag` and `catchTags` combinators to recover from or handle specific tagged error types in the Effect failure channel.  
This enables precise, type-safe error recovery and is especially useful for domain-specific error handling.

## Rationale

Not all errors should be handled the same way.  
By matching on specific error tags, you can provide targeted recovery logic for each error type, while letting unhandled errors propagate as needed.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/pattern-catchtag.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
- `catchTag` lets you recover from a specific tagged error type.
- `catchTags` lets you handle multiple tagged error types in one place.
- Unhandled errors continue to propagate, preserving error safety.

## Anti-Pattern

Catching all errors generically (e.g., with `catchAll`) and using manual type checks or property inspection, which is less safe and more error-prone than using tagged error combinators.

# Wrapping Synchronous and Asynchronous Computations

## Guideline

Use the `try` and `tryPromise` constructors to safely wrap synchronous or asynchronous computations that may throw exceptions or reject promises.  
This captures errors in the Effect failure channel, making them type-safe and composable.

## Rationale

Wrapping potentially unsafe code in `try` or `tryPromise` ensures that all errors are handled in a uniform, declarative way.  
This eliminates the need for try/catch blocks and makes error handling explicit and type-safe.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/constructor-try-trypromise.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
- `Effect.try` wraps a synchronous computation that may throw, capturing the error in the failure channel.
- `Effect.tryPromise` wraps an async computation (Promise) that may reject, capturing the rejection as a failure.

## Anti-Pattern

Using try/catch for error handling, or relying on untyped Promise rejections, which leads to less composable and less type-safe code.

# Use `Chunk` for High-Performance Collections

## Guideline

Use the `Chunk<A>` data type as an immutable, high-performance alternative to JavaScript's `Array`.  
`Chunk` is optimized for functional programming, batch processing, and streaming scenarios.

## Rationale

`Chunk` provides efficient, immutable operations for large or frequently transformed collections.  
It avoids the pitfalls of mutable arrays and is designed for use in concurrent and streaming workflows.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/data-chunk.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
- `Chunk` is immutable and optimized for performance.
- It supports efficient batch operations, concatenation, and transformation.
- Use `Chunk` in data pipelines, streaming, and concurrent scenarios.

## Anti-Pattern

Using mutable JavaScript arrays for shared or concurrent data, or for large-scale data processing, which can lead to bugs, inefficiency, and unpredictable behavior.

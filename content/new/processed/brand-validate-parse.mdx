# Validating and Parsing Branded Types

## Guideline

Use `Schema` in combination with `Brand` to validate and parse branded types at runtime.  
This ensures that only values passing your validation logic can be constructed as branded types, making your domain models robust and type-safe.

## Rationale

While branding types at the type level prevents accidental misuse, runtime validation is needed to ensure only valid values are constructed from user input, APIs, or external sources.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/brand-validate-parse.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
- `Schema` is used to define validation logic for the branded type.
- `Brand.schema<Email>()` attaches the brand to the schema, so only validated values can be constructed as `Email`.
- This pattern ensures both compile-time and runtime safety.

## Anti-Pattern

Branding values without runtime validation, or accepting unvalidated user input as branded types, which can lead to invalid domain values and runtime bugs.

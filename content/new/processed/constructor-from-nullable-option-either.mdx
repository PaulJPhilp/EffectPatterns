# Converting from Nullable, Option, or Either

## Guideline

Use `Effect.fromNullable` to convert nullable values into Effects.  
To convert an `Option` or `Either` into an Effect, use `Option.match` or `Either.match` to handle both cases and return an Effect.  
This enables safe, typeful interop with legacy code, APIs, or libraries that use `null`, `undefined`, or their own option/either types.

## Rationale

Converting to Effect, Stream, Option, or Either lets you use all the combinators, error handling, and resource safety of the Effect ecosystem, while avoiding the pitfalls of `null` and `undefined`.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/constructor-from-nullable-option-either.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
- `Effect.fromNullable` lifts a nullable value into an Effect, failing if the value is `null` or `undefined`.
- To lift an `Option` into an Effect, use `Option.match` to return `Effect.fail` for `none` and `Effect.succeed` for `some`.
- To lift an `Either` into an Effect, use `Either.match` to return `Effect.fail` for `left` and `Effect.succeed` for `right`.

## Anti-Pattern

Passing around `null`, `undefined`, or custom option/either types without converting them, which leads to unsafe, non-composable code and harder error handling.  
Using non-existent constructors like `Effect.fromOption` or `Effect.fromEither` instead of pattern matching.

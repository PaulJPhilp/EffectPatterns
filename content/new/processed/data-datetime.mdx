# Work with Dates and Times using `DateTime`

## Guideline

Use the `DateTime` data type to represent and manipulate dates and times in a type-safe, immutable, and time-zone-aware way.  
This enables safe, precise, and reliable time calculations in your applications.

## Rationale

JavaScript's native `Date` is mutable, not time-zone-aware, and can be error-prone.  
`DateTime` provides an immutable, functional alternative with explicit time zone handling and robust APIs for time arithmetic.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/data-datetime.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
- `DateTime` is immutable and time-zone-aware.
- Supports parsing, formatting, arithmetic, and comparison.
- Use for all date/time logic to avoid bugs with native `Date`.
- If you encounter generator/yield type errors in TypeScript, add an explicit type annotation to the generator function (e.g., `Effect.Effect<never, void, never>`) for clarity and compatibility.

## Anti-Pattern

Using JavaScript's mutable `Date` for time calculations, or ignoring time zones, which can lead to subtle and hard-to-debug errors.

# Type Classes for Equality, Ordering, and Hashing with `Data.Class`

## Guideline

Use `Data.Class` to derive or implement type classes for equality, ordering, and hashing for your custom data types.  
This enables composable, type-safe abstractions and allows your types to work seamlessly with Effect’s collections and algorithms.

## Rationale

Type classes like `Equal`, `Order`, and `Hash` provide a principled way to define how your types are compared, ordered, and hashed.  
This is essential for using your types in sets, maps, and for sorting or deduplication.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/data-class.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
- `Data.Class.getEqual` derives an equality type class for your data type.
- `Data.Class.getOrder` derives an ordering type class, useful for sorting.
- `Data.Class.getHash` derives a hash function for use in sets and maps.
- These type classes make your types fully compatible with Effect’s collections and algorithms.

## Anti-Pattern

Relying on reference equality, ad-hoc comparison functions, or not providing type class instances for your custom types, which can lead to bugs and inconsistent behavior in collections.

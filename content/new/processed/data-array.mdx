# Working with Immutable Arrays using `Data.array`

## Guideline

Use `Data.array` to create immutable, type-safe arrays that support value-based equality and safe functional operations.  
This is useful for modeling ordered collections where immutability and structural equality are important.

## Rationale

JavaScript arrays are mutable and compared by reference, which can lead to bugs in value-based logic and concurrent code.  
`Data.array` provides immutable arrays with structural equality, making them ideal for functional programming and safe domain modeling.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/data-array.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
- `Data.array` creates immutable arrays with value-based equality.
- Useful for modeling ordered collections in a safe, functional way.
- Supports all standard array operations, but with immutability and structural equality.
- If you encounter generator/yield type errors in TypeScript, add an explicit type annotation to the generator function (e.g., `Effect.Effect<never, void, never>`) for clarity and compatibility.

## Anti-Pattern

Using plain JavaScript arrays for value-based logic, as keys in sets/maps, or in concurrent code, which can lead to bugs due to mutability and reference-based comparison.

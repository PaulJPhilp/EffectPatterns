# Working with Tuples using `Data.tuple`

## Guideline

Use `Data.tuple` to create immutable, type-safe tuples that support value-based equality and pattern matching.  
This is useful for modeling fixed-size, heterogeneous collections of values in a safe and expressive way.

## Rationale

JavaScript arrays are mutable and compared by reference, which can lead to bugs in value-based logic.  
`Data.tuple` provides immutable tuples with structural equality, making them ideal for domain modeling and functional programming patterns.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/data-tuple.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
- `Data.tuple` creates immutable tuples with value-based equality.
- Useful for modeling pairs, coordinates, or any fixed-size, heterogeneous data.
- Supports safe pattern matching and collection operations.

## Anti-Pattern

Using plain arrays for value-based logic or as keys in sets/maps, which compares by reference and can lead to incorrect behavior.

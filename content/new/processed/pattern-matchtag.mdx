# Matching Tagged Unions with `matchTag` and `matchTags`

## Guideline

Use the `matchTag` and `matchTags` combinators to pattern match on specific cases of tagged unions or custom error types.  
This enables precise, type-safe branching and is especially useful for handling domain-specific errors or ADTs.

## Rationale

Tagged unions (a.k.a. algebraic data types or ADTs) are a powerful way to model domain logic.  
Pattern matching on tags lets you handle each case explicitly, making your code robust, maintainable, and exhaustive.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/pattern-matchtag.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
- `matchTag` lets you branch on the specific tag of a tagged union or custom error type.
- This is safer and more maintainable than using `instanceof` or manual property checks.

## Anti-Pattern

Using `instanceof`, manual property checks, or switch statements to distinguish between cases, which is error-prone and less type-safe than declarative pattern matching.

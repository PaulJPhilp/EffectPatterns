# Model Optional Values Safely with `Option`

## Guideline

Use the `Option<A>` data type to represent values that may or may not exist.  
This eliminates the need for `null` or `undefined`, making absence explicit and type-safe.

## Rationale

`Option` makes it impossible to forget to handle the "no value" case.  
It improves code safety, readability, and composability, and is a foundation for robust domain modeling.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/data-option.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
- `Option.some(value)` represents a present value.
- `Option.none()` represents absence.
- `Option.fromNullable` safely lifts nullable values into Option.
- Pattern matching ensures all cases are handled.

## Anti-Pattern

Using `null` or `undefined` to represent absence, or forgetting to handle the "no value" case, which leads to runtime errors and less maintainable code.

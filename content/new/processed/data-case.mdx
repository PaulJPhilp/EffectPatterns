# Modeling Tagged Unions with `Data.case`

## Guideline

Use `Data.case` to create tagged unions (algebraic data types, or ADTs) for robust, type-safe domain modeling.  
Tagged unions make it easy to represent and exhaustively handle all possible states of your domain entities.

## Rationale

Modeling domain logic with tagged unions ensures that all cases are handled, prevents illegal states, and enables safe, exhaustive pattern matching.  
`Data.case` provides a concise, type-safe way to define and use ADTs in your application.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/data-case.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
- `Data.case` creates tagged constructors for each state.
- The `_tag` property enables exhaustive pattern matching.
- Use for domain modeling, state machines, and error types.

## Anti-Pattern

Using plain objects or enums for domain states, which can lead to illegal states, missed cases, and less type-safe pattern matching.

# Handling Errors with `catchAll`, `orElse`, and `match`

## Guideline

Use combinators like `catchAll`, `orElse`, and `match` to handle errors declaratively.  
These allow you to recover from failures, provide fallback values, or transform errors, all while preserving composability and type safety.

## Rationale

Error handling is a first-class concern in functional programming.  
By using combinators, you keep error recovery logic close to where errors may occur, and avoid scattering try/catch or null checks throughout your code.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/combinator-error-handling.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
These combinators let you handle errors, provide defaults, or transform error values in a way that is composable and type-safe.  
You can recover from errors, provide alternative computations, or pattern match on success/failure.

## Anti-Pattern

Using try/catch, null checks, or imperative error handling outside the combinator world.  
This breaks composability, loses type safety, and makes error propagation unpredictable.

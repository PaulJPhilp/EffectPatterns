# Lifting Errors and Absence with `fail`, `none`, and `left`

## Guideline

Use the `fail`, `none`, and `left` constructors to represent errors or absence in the Effect, Option, or Either world.  
This makes failures explicit, type-safe, and composable.

## Rationale

By lifting errors and absence into these structures, you can handle them declaratively with combinators, rather than relying on exceptions, `null`, or `undefined`.  
This leads to more robust and maintainable code.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/constructor-fail-none-left.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
- `Effect.fail(error)` creates an effect that always fails with `error`.
- `Option.none()` creates an option that is always absent.
- `Either.left(error)` creates an either that always represents failure.

## Anti-Pattern

Throwing exceptions, returning `null` or `undefined`, or using error codes outside the Effect, Option, or Either world.  
This makes error handling ad hoc, less type-safe, and harder to compose.

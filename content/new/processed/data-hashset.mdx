# Work with Immutable Sets using `HashSet`

## Guideline

Use the `HashSet<A>` data type to represent sets of unique values with efficient, immutable operations.  
`HashSet` is ideal for membership checks, set algebra, and modeling collections where uniqueness matters.

## Rationale

`HashSet` provides high-performance, immutable set operations that are safe for concurrent and functional programming.  
It avoids the pitfalls of mutable JavaScript `Set` and is optimized for use in Effect workflows.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/data-hashset.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
- `HashSet` is immutable and supports efficient set operations.
- Use it for membership checks, set algebra, and modeling unique collections.
- Safe for concurrent and functional workflows.

## Anti-Pattern

Using mutable JavaScript `Set` for shared or concurrent data, or for set operations in functional code, which can lead to bugs and unpredictable behavior.

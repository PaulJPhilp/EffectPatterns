# Combining Values with `zip`

## Guideline

Use the `zip` combinator to combine two computations, pairing their results together.  
This works for `Effect` and `Stream`.  
For `Option` and `Either`, use manual pattern matching to combine values if both are present/right.

## Rationale

`zip` lets you compose computations that are independent but whose results you want to use together.  
It preserves error handling and context, and keeps your code declarative and type-safe.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/combinator-zip.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
`zip` runs both computations and pairs their results for `Effect` and `Stream`.  
For `Option` and `Either`, you can pair values using conditional logic: if both are `Some`/`Right`, return a tuple; otherwise, return `None`/`Left`.
If either computation fails (or is None/Left/empty), the result is a failure (or None/Left/empty).

## Anti-Pattern

Manually running two computations, extracting their results, and pairing them outside the combinator world for `Effect` and `Stream`.  
For `Option` and `Either`, avoid deeply nested conditionalsâ€”prefer concise pattern matching.
This breaks composability, loses error/context handling, and can lead to subtle bugs.

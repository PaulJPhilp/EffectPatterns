# Combining Values with `zip`

## Guideline

Use the `zip` combinator to combine two computations, pairing their results together.  
This works for `Effect`, `Stream`, `Option`, and `Either`, and is useful when you want to run two computations and work with both results.

## Rationale

`zip` lets you compose computations that are independent but whose results you want to use together.  
It preserves error handling and context, and keeps your code declarative and type-safe.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/combinator-zip.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
`zip` runs both computations and pairs their results.  
If either computation fails (or is None/Left/empty), the result is a failure (or None/Left/empty).

## Anti-Pattern

Manually running two computations, extracting their results, and pairing them outside the combinator world.  
This breaks composability, loses error/context handling, and can lead to subtle bugs.

## Guideline

To add cross-cutting concerns like caching to a service, create a "wrapper" `Layer`. This is a layer that takes the original service's `Layer` as input (as a dependency) and returns a new `Layer`. The new layer provides the same service interface but wraps the original methods with additional logic (e.g., checking a cache before calling the original method).

---

## Rationale

You often want to add functionality like caching, logging, or metrics to a service without polluting its core business logic. The wrapper layer pattern is a clean way to achieve this.

By creating a layer that *requires* the original service, you can get an instance of it from the context, and then provide a *new* implementation of that same service that calls the original.

This approach is powerful because:
-   **It's Non-Invasive:** The original service (`DatabaseLive`) remains completely unchanged.
-   **It's Composable:** You can apply multiple wrappers. You could wrap a database layer with a caching layer, then wrap that with a metrics layer.
-   **It's Explicit:** The composition is clearly defined at the application's top level where you build your final `AppLayer`.

## Good Example

We have a `WeatherService` that makes slow API calls. We create a `WeatherService.cached` wrapper layer that adds an in-memory cache using a `Ref` and a `Map`.

## Anti-Pattern

Modifying the original service implementation to include caching logic directly. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle by mixing the core logic of fetching weather with the cross-cutting concern of caching.

```typescript
// ‚ùå WRONG: The service is now responsible for both its logic and its caching strategy.
const WeatherServiceWithInlineCache = Layer.effect(
  WeatherService,
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const cache = yield* Ref.make(new Map<string, string>());
    return WeatherService.of({
      getForecast: (city) => {
        // ...caching logic mixed directly with fetching logic...
        return Effect.succeed("...");
      },
    });
  }),
);
```

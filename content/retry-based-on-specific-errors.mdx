## Guideline

To selectively retry an operation, use `Effect.retry` with a `Schedule` that includes a predicate. The most common way is to use `Schedule.whileInput((error) => ...)`, which will continue retrying only as long as the predicate returns `true` for the error that occurred.

---

## Rationale

Not all errors are created equal. Retrying on a permanent error like "permission denied" or "not found" is pointless and can hide underlying issues. You only want to retry on *transient*, recoverable errors, such as network timeouts or "server busy" responses.

By adding a predicate to your retry schedule, you gain fine-grained control over the retry logic. This allows you to build much more intelligent and efficient error handling systems that react appropriately to different failure modes. This is a common requirement for building robust clients for external APIs.

---

## Good Example

This example simulates an API client that can fail with different, specific error types. The retry policy is configured to *only* retry on `ServerBusyError` and give up immediately on `NotFoundError`.

```typescript
import { Effect, Data, Schedule, Duration } from "effect";

// Define specific, tagged errors for our API client
class ServerBusyError extends Data.TaggedError("ServerBusyError") {}
class NotFoundError extends Data.TaggedError("NotFoundError") {}

// A flaky API call that can fail in different ways
const flakyApiCall = Effect.try({
  try: () => {
    const random = Math.random();
    if (random < 0.5) {
      console.log("API call failed: Server is busy. Retrying...");
      throw new ServerBusyError();
    }
    if (random < 0.8) {
      console.log("API call failed: Resource not found. Not retrying.");
      throw new NotFoundError();
    }
    return { data: "success" };
  },
  catch: (e) => e as ServerBusyError | NotFoundError,
});

// A predicate that returns true only for the error we want to retry
const isRetryableError = (e: ServerBusyError | NotFoundError) =>
  e._tag === "ServerBusyError";

// A policy that retries 3 times, but only if the error is retryable
const selectiveRetryPolicy = Schedule.recurs(3).pipe(
  Schedule.whileInput(isRetryableError),
  Schedule.addDelay(() => "100 millis"),
);

const program = flakyApiCall.pipe(Effect.retry(selectiveRetryPolicy));

Effect.runPromise(program);
```

---

## Anti-Pattern

Using a generic `Effect.retry` that retries on all errors. This can lead to wasted resources and obscure permanent issues.

```typescript
import { Effect, Schedule } from "effect";
import { flakyApiCall } from "./somewhere"; // From previous example

// ‚ùå WRONG: This policy will retry even if the API returns a 404 Not Found.
// This wastes time and network requests on an error that will never succeed.
const blindRetryPolicy = Schedule.recurs(3);

const program = flakyApiCall.pipe(Effect.retry(blindRetryPolicy));
```

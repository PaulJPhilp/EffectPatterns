# Control Flow with Conditional Combinators

## Guideline

Use declarative combinators like `Effect.if`, `Effect.when`, and
`Effect.unless` to execute effects based on runtime conditions.

## Rationale

These combinators allow you to embed conditional logic directly into your
`.pipe()` compositions, maintaining a declarative style for simple branching.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/control-flow-with-combinators.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
`Effect.if` and related combinators allow you to branch logic without leaving
the Effect world or breaking the flow of composition.

## Anti-Pattern

Using `Effect.gen` for a single, simple conditional check can be more verbose
than necessary. For simple branching, `Effect.if` is often more concise.

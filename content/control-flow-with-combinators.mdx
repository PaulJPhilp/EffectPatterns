# Control Flow with Conditional Combinators

## Guideline

Use declarative combinators like `Effect.if`, `Effect.when`, and
`Effect.unless` to execute effects based on runtime conditions.

## Rationale

These combinators allow you to embed conditional logic directly into your
`.pipe()` compositions, maintaining a declarative style for simple branching.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";

const attemptAdminAction = (user: { isAdmin: boolean }) =>
  Effect.if(user.isAdmin, {
    onTrue: Effect.succeed("Admin action completed."),
    onFalse: Effect.fail("Permission denied."),
  });
```

**Explanation:**  
`Effect.if` and related combinators allow you to branch logic without leaving
the Effect world or breaking the flow of composition.

## Anti-Pattern

Using `Effect.gen` for a single, simple conditional check can be more verbose
than necessary. For simple branching, `Effect.if` is often more concise.

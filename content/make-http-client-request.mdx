## Guideline

To call an external API from within your server, use the `Http.client` module. This creates an `Effect` that represents the outgoing request, keeping it fully integrated with the Effect runtime.

---

## Rationale

An API server often needs to communicate with other services. While you could use the native `fetch` API, this breaks out of the Effect ecosystem and forfeits its most powerful features. Using the built-in `Http.client` is superior for several critical reasons:

1.  **Full Integration**: An `Http.client` request is a first-class `Effect`. This means it seamlessly composes with all other effects. You can add timeouts, retry logic (`Schedule`), or race it with other operations using the standard Effect operators you already know.
2.  **Structured Concurrency**: This is a key benefit. If the original incoming request to your server is cancelled or times out, Effect will automatically interrupt the outgoing `Http.client` request. A raw `fetch` call would continue running in the background, wasting resources.
3.  **Typed Errors**: The client provides a rich set of typed errors (e.g., `Http.error.RequestError`, `Http.error.ResponseError`). This allows you to write precise error handling logic to distinguish between a network failure and a non-2xx response from the external API.
4.  **Testability**: The `Http.client` can be provided via a `Layer`, making it trivial to mock in tests. You can test your route's logic without making actual network calls, leading to faster and more reliable tests.

---

## Good Example

This example creates a proxy endpoint. A request to `/proxy/posts/1` on our server will trigger an outgoing request to the JSONPlaceholder API. The response is then parsed and relayed back to the original client.

```typescript
import { Effect } from 'effect';
import { Http, NodeHttpServer, NodeRuntime } from '@effect/platform-node';

const proxyRoute = Http.router.get(
  '/proxy/posts/:id',
  Effect.flatMap(Http.request.ServerRequest, (req) =>
    // 1. Create a GET request to the external API.
    Http.client.request.get(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/${req.params.id}`).pipe(
      // 2. Execute it with the default client and ensure a 2xx response.
      Http.client.request.filterStatusOk,
      // 3. Parse the response body as JSON.
      Effect.flatMap(Http.client.response.json),
      // 4. Map the successful result to our server's JSON response.
      Effect.map(Http.response.json),
      // 5. If any step fails (network, status, parsing), return a 502 error.
      Effect.catchAll(() =>
        Http.response.text('Error communicating with external service', {
          status: 502, // Bad Gateway
        })
      )
    )
  )
);

const app = Http.router.empty.pipe(Http.router.addRoute(proxyRoute));

const program = Http.server.serve(app).pipe(
  Effect.provide(NodeHttpServer.layer({ port: 3000 }))
);

NodeRuntime.runMain(program);
```

## Anti-Pattern

The anti-pattern is to use `fetch` inside a route handler, wrapped in `Effect.tryPromise`. This approach requires manual error handling and loses the benefits of the Effect ecosystem.

```typescript
import { Effect } from 'effect';
import { Http, NodeHttpServer, NodeRuntime } from '@effect/platform-node';

const proxyRoute = Http.router.get(
  '/proxy/posts/:id',
  Effect.flatMap(Http.request.ServerRequest, (req) =>
    // Manually wrap fetch in an Effect
    Effect.tryPromise({
      try: () => fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/${req.params.id}`),
      catch: () => 'FetchError', // Untyped error
    }).pipe(
      Effect.flatMap((res) =>
        // Manually check status and parse JSON, each with its own error case
        res.ok
          ? Effect.tryPromise({ try: () => res.json(), catch: () => 'JsonError' })
          : Effect.fail('BadStatusError')
      ),
      Effect.map(Http.response.json),
      // A generic catch-all because we can't easily distinguish error types
      Effect.catchAll(() => Http.response.text('An unknown error occurred', { status: 500 }))
    )
  )
);

const app = Http.router.empty.pipe(Http.router.addRoute(proxyRoute));

const program = Http.server.serve(app).pipe(
  Effect.provide(NodeHttpServer.layer({ port: 3000 }))
);

NodeRuntime.runMain(program);
```

This manual approach is significantly more complex and less safe. It forces you to reinvent status and parsing logic, uses untyped string-based errors, and most importantly, the `fetch` call will not be automatically interrupted if the parent request is cancelled.

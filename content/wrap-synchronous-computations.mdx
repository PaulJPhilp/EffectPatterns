# Wrap Synchronous Computations with sync and try

## Guideline

To bring a synchronous side-effect into Effect, wrap it in a thunk (`() => ...`).
Use `Effect.sync` for functions guaranteed not to throw, and `Effect.try` for
functions that might throw.

## Rationale

This is the primary way to safely integrate with synchronous libraries like
`JSON.parse`. `Effect.try` captures any thrown exception and moves it into
the Effect's error channel.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";

const randomNumber = Effect.sync(() => Math.random());

const parseJson = (input: string) =>
  Effect.try({
    try: () => JSON.parse(input),
    catch: (error) => new Error(`JSON parsing failed: ${error}`),
  });
```

**Explanation:**  
Use `Effect.sync` for safe synchronous code, and `Effect.try` to safely
handle exceptions from potentially unsafe code.

## Anti-Pattern

Never use `Effect.sync` for an operation that could throw, like `JSON.parse`.
This can lead to unhandled exceptions that crash your application.

## Guideline

To enable graceful shutdown for a long-running application:
1.  Define services with cleanup logic in `scoped` `Layer`s using `Effect.addFinalizer` or `Effect.acquireRelease`.
2.  Launch your main application `Effect` using `Effect.runFork` to get a `Fiber` handle to the running process.
3.  Set up listeners for process signals like `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C) and `SIGTERM`.
4.  In the signal handler, call `Fiber.interrupt` on your application's fiber.

---

## Rationale

When a server process is terminated, you need to ensure that it cleans up properly. This includes closing database connections, finishing in-flight requests, and releasing file handles. Failing to do so can lead to resource leaks or data corruption.

Effect's structured concurrency makes this robust and easy. When a fiber is interrupted, Effect guarantees that it will run all finalizers registered within that fiber's scope, in the reverse order they were acquired.

By launching your app with `runFork`, you get a `Fiber` that represents the entire application. Triggering `Fiber.interrupt` on this top-level fiber initiates a clean, orderly shutdown sequence for all its resources.

---

## Good Example

This example creates a server with a "scoped" database connection. It uses `runFork` to start the server and sets up a `SIGINT` handler to interrupt the server fiber, which in turn guarantees the database finalizer is called.

```typescript
import { Effect, Layer, Fiber } from "effect";
import * as http from "http";

// 1. A service with a finalizer for cleanup
class Database extends Effect.Tag("Database")<Database, { query: () => Effect.Effect<string> }> {}
const DatabaseLive = Layer.scoped(
  Database,
  Effect.acquireRelease(
    Effect.log("Acquiring DB connection").pipe(Effect.as({ query: () => Effect.succeed("data") })),
    () => Effect.log("DB connection closed."),
  ),
);

// 2. The main server logic
const server = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const db = yield* Database;
  const server = http.createServer((_req, res) => {
    Effect.runFork(
      db.query().pipe(
        Effect.map((data) => res.end(data)),
      ),
    );
  });
  // Add a finalizer to the server itself
  yield* Effect.addFinalizer(() => Effect.sync(() => server.close()));
  server.listen(3000);
  yield* Effect.log("Server started on port 3000. Press Ctrl+C to exit.");
  // This will keep the effect running forever until interrupted
  yield* Effect.never;
});

// 3. Provide the layer and launch with runFork
const app = Effect.provide(server, DatabaseLive);
const appFiber = Effect.runFork(app);

// 4. Listen for Ctrl+C and interrupt the fiber
process.on("SIGINT", () => {
  console.log("\nReceived SIGINT. Shutting down gracefully...");
  Effect.runFork(Fiber.interrupt(appFiber));
});
```

## Anti-Pattern

Letting the Node.js process exit without proper cleanup. If you run a long-running effect with `Effect.runPromise` or don't handle OS signals, pressing Ctrl+C will terminate the process abruptly, and none of your `Effect` finalizers will have a chance to run.

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";
import { app } from "./somewhere"; // From previous example

// ‚ùå WRONG: This will run the server, but Ctrl+C will kill it instantly.
// The database connection finalizer will NOT be called.
Effect.runPromise(app);
```

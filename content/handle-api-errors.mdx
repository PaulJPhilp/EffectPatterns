## Guideline

Define specific error types for your application logic and use `Http.server.serveOptions` with a custom `unhandledErrorResponse` function to map those errors to appropriate HTTP status codes and responses.

---

## Rationale

By default, any unhandled failure in an Effect route handler results in a generic `500 Internal Server Error`. This is a safe default, but it's not helpful for API clients who need to know *why* their request failed. Was it a client-side error (like a non-existent resource, `404`) or a true server-side problem (`500`)?

Centralizing error handling at the server level provides a clean separation of concerns:

1.  **Domain-Focused Logic**: Your business logic can fail with specific, descriptive errors (e.g., `UserNotFoundError`) without needing any knowledge of HTTP status codes.
2.  **Centralized Mapping**: You define the mapping from application errors to HTTP responses in a single location. This makes your API's error handling consistent and easy to maintain. If you need to change how an error is reported, you only change it in one place.
3.  **Type Safety**: Using `Data.TaggedClass` for your errors allows you to use `Match` to exhaustively handle all known error cases, preventing you from forgetting to map a specific error type.
4.  **Clear Client Communication**: It produces a predictable and useful API, allowing clients to programmatically react to different failure scenarios.

---

## Good Example

This example defines two custom error types, `UserNotFoundError` and `InvalidIdError`. The route logic can fail with either. The `unhandledErrorResponse` function inspects the error and returns a `404` or `400` response accordingly, with a generic `500` for any other unexpected errors.

## Anti-Pattern

The anti-pattern is to handle HTTP-specific error logic inside each route handler using functions like `Effect.catchTag`.

```typescript
import { Effect, Data } from 'effect';
import { Http, NodeHttpServer, NodeRuntime } from '@effect/platform-node';

class UserNotFoundError extends Data.TaggedError('UserNotFoundError')<{ id: string }> {}
// ... same getUser function and error classes

const userRoute = Http.router.get(
  '/users/:userId',
  Effect.flatMap(Http.request.ServerRequest, (req) => getUser(req.params.userId)).pipe(
    Effect.map(Http.response.json),
    // Manually catching errors inside the route logic
    Effect.catchTag('UserNotFoundError', (e) =>
      Http.response.text(`User ${e.id} not found`, { status: 404 })
    ),
    Effect.catchTag('InvalidIdError', (e) =>
      Http.response.text(`ID ${e.id} is not a valid format`, { status: 400 })
    )
  )
);

const app = Http.router.empty.pipe(Http.router.addRoute(userRoute));

// No centralized error handling
const program = Http.server.serve(app).pipe(
  Effect.provide(NodeHttpServer.layer({ port: 3000 }))
);

NodeRuntime.runMain(program);
```

This approach is problematic because it pollutes the business logic of the route handler with details about HTTP status codes. It's also highly repetitive; if ten different routes could produce a `UserNotFoundError`, you would need to copy this `catchTag` logic into all ten of them, making the API difficult to maintain.

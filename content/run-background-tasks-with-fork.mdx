## Guideline

To start an `Effect` in the background without blocking the current execution flow, use `Effect.fork`. This immediately returns a `Fiber`, which is a handle to the running computation that you can use to manage its lifecycle (e.g., interrupt it or wait for its result).

---

## Rationale

Unlike `Effect.all` or a direct `yield*`, which wait for the computation to complete, `Effect.fork` is a "fire and forget" operation. It starts the effect on a new, concurrent fiber and immediately returns control to the parent fiber.

This is essential for managing long-running background tasks like:
-   A web server listener.
-   A message queue consumer.
-   A periodic cache cleanup job.

The returned `Fiber` object is your remote control for the background task. You can use `Fiber.interrupt` to safely stop it (ensuring all its finalizers are run) or `Fiber.join` to wait for it to complete at some later point.

---

## Good Example

This program forks a background process that logs a "tick" every second. The main process does its own work for 5 seconds and then explicitly interrupts the background logger before exiting.

## Anti-Pattern

The anti-pattern is using `Effect.fork` when you immediately need the result of the computation. This is an overly complicated and less readable way of just running the effect directly.

```typescript
import { Effect, Fiber } from "effect";

const someEffect = Effect.succeed(42);

// ❌ WRONG: This is unnecessarily complex.
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const fiber = yield* Effect.fork(someEffect);
  // You immediately wait for the result, defeating the purpose of forking.
  const result = yield* Fiber.join(fiber);
  return result;
});

// ✅ CORRECT: Just run the effect directly if you need its result right away.
const simplerProgram = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const result = yield* someEffect;
  return result;
});
```

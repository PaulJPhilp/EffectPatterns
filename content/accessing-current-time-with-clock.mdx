## Guideline

Whenever you need to get the current time within an `Effect`, do not call `Date.now()` directly. Instead, depend on the `Clock` service and use one of its methods, such as `Clock.currentTimeMillis`.

---

## Rationale

Directly calling `Date.now()` makes your code impure and tightly coupled to the system clock. This makes testing difficult and unreliable, as the output of your function will change every time it's run.

The `Clock` service is Effect's solution to this problem. It's an abstraction for "the current time."
-   In **production**, the default `Live` `Clock` implementation uses the real system time.
-   In **tests**, you can provide the `TestClock` layer. This gives you a virtual clock that you can manually control, allowing you to set the time to a specific value or advance it by a specific duration.

This makes any time-dependent logic pure, deterministic, and easy to test with perfect precision.

---

## Good Example

This example shows a function that checks if a token is expired. Its logic depends on `Clock`, making it fully testable.

---

## Anti-Pattern

Directly calling `Date.now()` inside your business logic. This creates an impure function that cannot be tested reliably without manipulating the system clock, which is a bad practice.

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";

interface Token { readonly expiresAt: number; }

// ‚ùå WRONG: This function's behavior changes every millisecond.
const isTokenExpiredUnsafely = (token: Token): Effect.Effect<boolean> =>
  Effect.sync(() => Date.now() > token.expiresAt);

// Testing this function would require complex mocking of global APIs
// or would be non-deterministic.
```

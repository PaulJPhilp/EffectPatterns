## Guideline

When you have multiple effects that can produce the same type of result, and you only care about the one that finishes first, use `Effect.race(effectA, effectB)`.

---

## Rationale

`Effect.race` is a powerful concurrency primitive for performance and resilience. It starts all provided effects in parallel. The moment one of them succeeds, `Effect.race` immediately interrupts all the other "losing" effects and returns the winning result. If one of the effects fails before any have succeeded, the race is not over; the remaining effects continue to run. The entire race only fails if *all* participating effects fail.

This is commonly used for:
-   **Performance:** Querying multiple redundant data sources (e.g., two API replicas) and taking the response from whichever is faster.
-   **Implementing Timeouts:** Racing a primary effect against a delayed `Effect.fail`, effectively creating a timeout mechanism.

---

## Good Example

A classic use case is checking a fast cache before falling back to a slower database. We can race the cache lookup against the database query.

## Anti-Pattern

Don't use `Effect.race` if you need the results of *all* the effects. That is the job of `Effect.all`. Using `race` in this scenario will cause you to lose data, as all but one of the effects will be interrupted and their results discarded.

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";

const fetchProfile = Effect.succeed({ name: "Paul" });
const fetchPermissions = Effect.succeed(["admin", "editor"]);

// ❌ WRONG: This will only return either the profile OR the permissions,
// whichever resolves first. You will lose the other piece of data.
const incompleteData = Effect.race(fetchProfile, fetchPermissions);

// ✅ CORRECT: Use Effect.all when you need all the results.
const completeData = Effect.all([fetchProfile, fetchPermissions]);
```

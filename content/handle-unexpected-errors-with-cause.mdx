# Handle Unexpected Errors by Inspecting the Cause

## Guideline

To build truly resilient applications, differentiate between known business
errors (`Fail`) and unknown defects (`Die`). Use `Effect.catchAllCause` to
inspect the full `Cause` of a failure.

## Rationale

The `Cause` object explains *why* an effect failed. A `Fail` is an expected
error (e.g., `ValidationError`). A `Die` is an unexpected defect (e.g., a
thrown exception). They should be handled differently.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/handle-unexpected-errors-with-cause.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
By inspecting the `Cause`, you can distinguish between expected and unexpected
failures, logging or escalating as appropriate.

## Anti-Pattern

Using a simple `Effect.catchAll` can dangerously conflate expected errors and
unexpected defects, masking critical bugs as recoverable errors.

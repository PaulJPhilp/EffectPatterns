# Create Pre-resolved Effects with succeed and fail

## Guideline

To lift a pure, already-known value into an `Effect`, use `Effect.succeed()`.
To represent an immediate and known failure, use `Effect.fail()`.

## Rationale

These are the simplest effect constructors, essential for returning static
values within functions that must return an `Effect`.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/create-pre-resolved-effect.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
Use `Effect.succeed` for values you already have, and `Effect.fail` for
immediate, known errors.

## Anti-Pattern

Do not wrap a static value in `Effect.sync`. While it works, `Effect.succeed`
is more descriptive and direct for values that are already available.

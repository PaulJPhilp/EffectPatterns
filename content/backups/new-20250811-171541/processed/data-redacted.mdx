# Redact and Handle Sensitive Data with `Redacted`

## Guideline

Use the `Redacted` data type to securely handle sensitive data such as passwords, API keys, or tokens.  
`Redacted` ensures that secrets are not accidentally logged, serialized, or exposed in error messages.

## Rationale

Sensitive data should never appear in logs, traces, or error messages.  
`Redacted` provides a type-safe way to mark and protect secrets throughout your application.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/data-redacted.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
- `Redacted.make(value)` wraps a sensitive value.
- When logged or stringified, the value is replaced with `<redacted>`.
- Prevents accidental exposure of secrets in logs or error messages.

## Anti-Pattern

Passing sensitive data as plain strings, which can be accidentally logged, serialized, or leaked in error messages.

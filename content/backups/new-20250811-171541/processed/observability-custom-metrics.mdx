# Add Custom Metrics to Your Application

## Guideline

Use Effect's `Metric` module to define and update custom metrics such as counters, gauges, and histograms.  
This allows you to track business events, performance indicators, and system health in a type-safe and composable way.

## Rationale

Metrics provide quantitative insight into your application's behavior and performance.  
By instrumenting your code with metrics, you can monitor key events, detect anomalies, and drive business decisions.

## Good Example

<Example path="./src/observability-custom-metrics.ts" />

**Explanation:**  
- `Metric.counter` tracks counts of events.
- `Metric.gauge` tracks a value that can go up or down (e.g., active users).
- `Metric.histogram` tracks distributions (e.g., request durations).
- `Effect.updateMetric` updates the metric in your workflow.

## Anti-Pattern

Relying solely on logs for monitoring, or using ad-hoc counters and variables that are not integrated with your observability stack.

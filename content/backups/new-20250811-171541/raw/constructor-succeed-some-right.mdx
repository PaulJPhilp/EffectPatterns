# Lifting Values with `succeed`, `some`, and `right`

## Guideline

Use the `succeed`, `some`, and `right` constructors to lift plain values into the Effect, Option, or Either world.  
This is the foundation for building composable, type-safe programs.

## Rationale

Lifting values into these structures allows you to compose them with other effects, options, or eithers, and to take advantage of all the combinators and error handling that Effect provides.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Effect, Option, Either } from "effect";

// Effect: Lift a value into an Effect that always succeeds
const effect = Effect.succeed(42); // Effect<never, number, never>

// Option: Lift a value into an Option that is always Some
const option = Option.some("hello"); // Option<string>

// Either: Lift a value into an Either that is always Right
const either = Either.right({ id: 1 }); // Either<never, { id: number }>
```

**Explanation:**  
- `Effect.succeed(value)` creates an effect that always succeeds with `value`.
- `Option.some(value)` creates an option that is always present.
- `Either.right(value)` creates an either that always represents success.

## Anti-Pattern

Passing plain values around outside the Effect, Option, or Either world, or using `null`/`undefined` to represent absence or success.  
This leads to less composable, less type-safe code and makes error handling harder.

## Guideline

Recognize that `Effect` is not just a "better Promise," but a fundamentally different construct designed to solve the core limitations of native `Promise`s in TypeScript:
1.  **Untyped Errors:** Promises can reject with `any` value, forcing `try/catch` blocks and unsafe type checks.
2.  **No Dependency Injection:** Promises have no built-in way to declare or manage dependencies, leading to tightly coupled code.
3.  **No Cancellation:** Once a `Promise` starts, it cannot be cancelled from the outside.

---

## Rationale

While `async/await` is great for simple cases, building large, robust applications with `Promise`s reveals these critical gaps. Effect addresses each one directly:

-   **Typed Errors:** The `E` channel in `Effect<A, E, R>` forces you to handle specific, known error types, eliminating an entire class of runtime bugs.
-   **Dependency Injection:** The `R` channel provides a powerful, built-in system for declaring and providing dependencies (`Layer`s), making your code modular and testable.
-   **Cancellation (Interruption):** Effect's structured concurrency and `Fiber` model provide robust, built-in cancellation. When an effect is interrupted, Effect guarantees that its cleanup logic (finalizers) will be run.

Understanding that Effect was built specifically to solve these problems is key to appreciating its design and power.

## Good Example (The Effect Way)

This code is type-safe, testable, and cancellable. The signature `Effect.Effect<User, DbError, HttpClient>` tells us everything we need to know.

## Anti-Pattern (The Promise Way)

This `Promise`-based function has several hidden problems that Effect solves:
-   What happens if `db.findUser` rejects? The error is untyped (`any`).
-   Where does `db` come from? It's a hidden dependency, making this function hard to test.
-   If the operation is slow, how do we cancel it? We can't.

```typescript
// ‚ùå This function has hidden dependencies and untyped errors.
async function findUserUnsafely(id: number): Promise<any> {
  try {
    const user = await db.findUser(id); // `db` is a hidden global or import
    return user;
  } catch (error) {
    // `error` is of type `any`. We don't know what it is.
    // We might log it and re-throw, but we can't handle it safely.
    throw error;
  }
}
```

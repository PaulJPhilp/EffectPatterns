# Model Dependencies as Services

## Guideline

Represent any external dependency or distinct capability—from a database client to a simple UUID generator—as a service.

## Rationale

This pattern is the key to testability. It allows you to provide a `Live` implementation in production and a `Test` implementation (returning mock data) in your tests, making your code decoupled and reliable.

## Good Example

```typescript
import { Effect, Layer } from "effect";

class Random extends Effect.Tag("Random")<Random, { readonly next: Effect.Effect<number> }> {}

// For production
const RandomLive = Layer.succeed(Random, { next: Effect.sync(() => Math.random()) });

// For testing
const RandomTest = Layer.succeed(Random, { next: Effect.succeed(0.5) });
```

**Explanation:**  
By modeling dependencies as services, you can easily substitute mocked or deterministic implementations for testing, leading to more reliable and predictable tests.

## Anti-Pattern

Directly calling external APIs like `fetch` or using impure functions like `Math.random()` within your business logic. This tightly couples your logic to a specific implementation and makes it difficult to test.

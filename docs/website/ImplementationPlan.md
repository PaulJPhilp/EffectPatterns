Great. Here’s a focused, actionable Implementation Plan you, the Agent, and I can execute. It’s broken into phases with milestones, tasks, and concrete deliverables. It assumes a fresh monorepo and targets a 2–3 week MVP.

PHASE 0 — Repo Bootstrap and Foundations (Day 0–1)
Milestones
- Monorepo scaffolded with Turborepo
- Next.js app ready
- Shared UI package ready
- Env/config wiring in place

Tasks
1. Create monorepo
- Init turborepo
- Packages: components, effect-clerk (scaffold), ai-toolkit (if not already), mcp-server (if not already)
- Apps: web

2. Add baseline tooling
- TypeScript strict config
- ESLint + Prettier
- GitHub Actions (build, lint, typecheck)
- .vscode settings (format on save)

3. UI library and theme
- Install Tailwind + Shadcn/ui in packages/components
- Extract typography and spacing to match your blog
- Build base components: LayoutShell, PageHeader, Card, Button, CodeBlock (with Copy + Run in Playground), ProgressBar

4. Environment config
- Add .env.sample and schema for required keys (Clerk, Convex, Polar, Postgres, AI model)
- Create Effect Config utility to read envs safely

Deliverables
- turbo.json, tsconfig, eslint/prettier
- apps/web booted, loads shared components package
- packages/components with initial primitives and theme
- .env.sample and config loader

PHASE 1 — Content Ingestion and Pattern Explorer (Days 2–4)
Milestones
- MDX ingestion to Postgres
- Pattern Explorer (SSR) with search/filter
- Pattern pages render MDX with Good Example → Playground button

Tasks
1. Postgres + Drizzle setup
- Choose Vercel Postgres or managed PG
- Install Drizzle, configure migrations, generate schema
- Create tables: patterns, users, learning_plans, pattern_progress

2. Pattern ingestion script
- Parse MDX frontmatter and file path
- Insert/update patterns in Postgres
- For now, store content_path and mdx_slug; MDX remains in repo for rendering
- Optional: store parsed fields like modules JSON and tags

3. PatternService and Repo
- Implement PatternRepository (Effect) backed by Drizzle
- Implement PatternService: list, byId, search (title/tags), related

4. Next.js routes
- / (Home): lists 10 modules
- /modules: module picker page
- /modules/:moduleId: list patterns (SSR)
- /patterns/:patternId: render MDX with CodeBlock component; add Good Example → Playground link (base64 encode)

5. Search page
- /search: RSC page; server-side search by title/tag; light client filter

Deliverables
- Drizzle schema and migrations
- ingest-patterns.ts script
- PatternService + Repository
- Pattern explorer and pattern pages working

PHASE 2 — Auth, Accounts, and Dashboard (Days 5–7)
Milestones
- Clerk integrated in Next.js (and Convex configured)
- User dashboard protected by middleware
- Basic progress tracking UI (local for now)
- Goal capture form (no LLM yet)

Tasks
1. Clerk integration
- Install @clerk/nextjs
- Add ClerkProvider in root layout
- Configure middleware to protect /dashboard
- Add SignIn/SignUp routes, header auth controls

2. Dashboard shell
- /dashboard: shows modules, current plan (empty state), CTA to set goal
- Components: Progress tracker, Plan phases list (placeholder)

3. Progress state (local)
- effect-atom for local dashboard filters; client-only for now
- Add “Mark as read” button on pattern pages storing temporary state (we’ll wire Convex next)

Deliverables
- Clerk working end-to-end
- Dashboard renders for logged-in users
- Basic progress UI (non-persistent for now)

PHASE 3 — Convex Real-time State (Days 8–9)
Milestones
- Convex project wired to web app
- sessions and plans_rt tables in Convex
- Real-time progress tracking across devices

Tasks
1. Convex setup
- Init Convex in apps/web
- Configure Clerk auth integration for Convex
- Create schema: sessions, plans_rt
- Write queries/mutations:
  - getSession, setSession
  - getPlanRt, setPlanRt, markPatternCompleted

2. Wire dashboard to Convex
- Subscribe to sessions + plans_rt on /dashboard
- Replace local “mark as read” with Convex mutation

3. Optional Postgres sync
- Create a Convex action to mirror plan/progress to Postgres (async)
- Or schedule a nightly sync initially

Deliverables
- Convex folder with schema and functions
- Real-time progress updates in dashboard
- Pattern “mark as read” persists across devices

PHASE 4 — Learning Plans via AI (Days 10–11)
Milestones
- Goal submission generates learning plan with LLM
- Plan stored in Postgres and mirrored to Convex
- Dashboard shows phases with progress calculated

Tasks
1. LearningPlanService
- Wrap Vercel AI SDK in Effect
- Inputs: userGoal, patterns catalog, optional focus module
- Output: phases[] with ordered patternIds + rationale
- Add timeout + retry Schedule; structured JSON output with schema

2. Plan generation route
- POST /api/plan/create: validates input with @effect/schema
- Calls LearningPlanService
- Stores in Postgres (learning_plans)
- Updates Convex plans_rt

3. Dashboard rendering
- Show phases with pattern checkboxes
- Progress bar per phase and overall

4. Free tier limit
- Add guard for free users: 1 plan total (or per month)
- Entitlement check temporarily based on users.tier in Postgres or Convex

Deliverables
- LearningPlanService with tests for shape
- API route for plan creation
- Dashboard renders real plan and updates in real-time

PHASE 5 — Payments (Polar) and Entitlements (Days 12–13)
Milestones
- Polar checkout flow integrated
- Webhook updates tier in Convex + Postgres
- Gating enforced in UI and server

Tasks
1. Polar integration
- Add checkout/create Convex action
- Frontend “Upgrade to Pro” button invokes action, redirects to Polar
- Webhook endpoint (Next or Convex HTTP function) verifies signature and sets tier
- Update both Convex sessions and Postgres users.tier

2. Gate features
- Free: 1 plan; Pro: unlimited
- Middleware or server guards enforce limits on /api/plan/create
- UI shows Upgrade CTA when user hits limit

Deliverables
- Working Polar checkout + webhook
- Tier updates propagate to UI
- Plan generation limits enforced

PHASE 6 — Polish, SEO, and Launch (Days 14–15)
Milestones
- Design polish to match paulphilp.com
- SEO: title/meta/og, sitemap, robots
- Performance pass and logging

Tasks
1. Design
- Finalize typographic rhythm, spacing, colors
- Ensure code blocks, lists, headings match blog’s tone
- Add footer links: GitHub repo, MCP server, AI Toolkit, CLI

2. SEO
- Titles, meta descriptions per page
- Open Graph images for modules/patterns
- Sitemap.xml, robots.txt
- Canonical URLs

3. Performance + logs
- Cache RSC results where safe
- Ensure PatternService has indices (title, tags)
- Add Effect.log on service boundaries
- Basic runtime error page

Deliverables
- Deployed MVP on Vercel
- Announcement checklist complete

AFTER LAUNCH — Post-MVP Roadmap (Week 3+)
- Add semantic search with embeddings (pgvector) and RAG hooks for tutor
- effect-convex extraction (Effect wrappers for Convex functions, typed schemas)
- effect-polar package (Effect service + webhook helpers)
- On-site chat (Vercel AI SDK) with plan context
- Code review tool prototype (LangGraph-based), CI hook
- OTEL backend setup, export traces/metrics/logs
- Recipes section build-out

  - convex/ (generated by Convex)
    - schema.ts (sessions, plans_rt)
    - queries.ts, mutations.ts, actions.ts (polar, sync)

AGENT PLAYBOOK (high level, detailed prompts coming next)
- Phase 0: Scaffold turborepo, add Next.js app, Tailwind/Shadcn, base components, env config
- Phase 1: Add Postgres + Drizzle, ingest patterns, implement PatternService, pages
- Phase 2: Integrate Clerk, build dashboard shell
- Phase 3: Add Convex, implement session/plan_rt, wire dashboard
- Phase 4: Add LLM plan generation with Vercel AI SDK
- Phase 5: Add Polar checkout and entitlements
- Phase 6: Polish + SEO + deploy

Dependencies and Risks
- Convex learning curve: we mitigate by using SDK directly for MVP
- Polar vs Stripe: Polar MoR simplifies tax but requires robust webhook handling
- Embeddings later: design schema now with future vector column
- Pattern MDX consistency: ensure frontmatter schema validation and ingestion tests

If this plan looks good, I’ll prepare the Agent Prompts next, broken down by phase with exact commands, file structures, and acceptance criteria.

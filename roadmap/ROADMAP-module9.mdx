# Module 9: Observability

Observability is essential for understanding, debugging, and maintaining your applications in production.  
Effect provides first-class support for structured logging, custom metrics, distributed tracing, and function-level instrumentation, making it easy to gain insight into your system’s behavior and performance.

This module will teach you how to use Effect’s observability tools to log important events, track business and performance metrics, trace operations across services, and instrument function calls.

## Learning Path

1.  #### [Leverage Effect's Built-in Structured Logging](./patterns/observability-structured-logging)
    **Goal**: Use Effect’s logging functions for structured, configurable, and context-aware logging.

2.  #### [Add Custom Metrics to Your Application](./patterns/observability-custom-metrics)
    **Goal**: Instrument your code with counters, gauges, and histograms to track key business and performance indicators.

3.  #### [Trace Operations Across Services with Spans](./patterns/observability-tracing-spans)
    **Goal**: Use `withSpan` to create custom tracing spans, providing detailed visibility into the performance and flow of your application’s operations.

4.  #### [Instrument and Observe Function Calls with Effect.fn](./patterns/observability-effect-fn)
    **Goal**: Wrap and instrument function calls with effectful logic for logging, metrics, or tracing.

5.  #### [Integrate Effect Tracing with OpenTelemetry](./patterns/observability-opentelemetry)
    **Goal**: Connect Effect’s tracing spans to OpenTelemetry for end-to-end distributed tracing and visualization.

**By the end of this module, you’ll be able to:**
- Add structured, context-aware logging to your Effect code.
- Track custom metrics for business and performance monitoring.
- Trace operations across services for deep observability and debugging.
- Instrument and observe function calls for fine-grained monitoring.
- Integrate with OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing across your stack.

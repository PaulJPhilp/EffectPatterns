# Effect Learning Roadmap Overview

A comprehensive guide to mastering Effect-TS through structured learning 
modules. This roadmap takes you from fundamental concepts to building 
production-ready applications.

---

## üéØ Learning Philosophy

The Effect learning roadmap follows a **progressive mastery approach**:

1. **Foundation First**: Understand why Effect exists and what problems it 
   solves
2. **Building Blocks**: Learn to compose small, reliable pieces into complex 
   programs
3. **Real-World Applications**: Apply patterns to build production-ready 
   systems
4. **Advanced Techniques**: Master sophisticated patterns for enterprise 
   applications

Each module builds on previous knowledge, introducing new concepts only when 
you have the foundation to understand them.

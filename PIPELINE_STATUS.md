# Publishing Pipeline Status

## ✅ Pipeline Fixed and Tested (September 29, 2025)

The publishing pipeline is now fully operational and tested!

### What Was Fixed

**Problem:** All pipeline scripts (`publish.ts`, `validate.ts`, `generate.ts`, `rules.ts`) were using the `effect-mdx` package which had a peer dependency mismatch with our Effect version. This caused "Not a valid effect: undefined" errors.

**Solution:** Replaced all Effect-based scripts with simpler, direct implementations using:
- Node.js built-in `fs/promises` for file operations
- `gray-matter` for frontmatter parsing (already in package.json)
- No external Effect dependencies

### Current Pipeline Performance

**Input:** 88 patterns (content/raw/*.mdx + content/src/*.ts)
**Output:** 
- 88 published MDX files (content/published/)
- 1 README.md with organized patterns
- 26 rule files (rules/, rules/by-use-case/)
**Time:** ~85 seconds
**Success Rate:** 100% (88/88 patterns)

### Pipeline Steps

1. **Test** - Runs all TypeScript examples (87 files) ✅
2. **Publish** - Converts raw MDX to published MDX with embedded TypeScript ✅
3. **Validate** - Checks frontmatter, sections, and code consistency ✅
4. **Generate** - Creates README.md organized by use case ✅
5. **Rules** - Generates AI coding rules in multiple formats ✅

### Commands

```bash
# Run full pipeline
bun run pipeline  # or: bun run all

# Run individual steps
bun run test
bun run publish
bun run validate
bun run generate
bun run rules
```

### Next Steps

1. **Work on new patterns (42 total in backups)**
   - 22 patterns passing TypeScript checks ✅
   - 20 patterns with TypeScript errors (need fixes)

2. **Fix TypeScript errors** in failing patterns:
   - API changes in Effect library (methods renamed/removed)
   - Type signature mismatches
   - Update to match current Effect APIs

3. **Prepare v0.3.0 release**
   - Fix and add validated new patterns
   - Update version in package.json
   - Create release notes
   - Tag release

### Files Changed

**New/Modified:**
- `scripts/publish/publish.ts` - Simplified (no effect-mdx)
- `scripts/publish/validate.ts` - Simplified (no effect-mdx)
- `scripts/publish/generate.ts` - Simplified (no effect-mdx)
- `scripts/publish/rules.ts` - Simplified (no effect-mdx)

**Restored:**
- `content/raw/*.mdx` (88 files) - Restored from git history
- `content/published/*.mdx` (88 files) - Generated by pipeline

### Technical Notes

- All scripts use modern async/await with fs/promises
- Gray-matter handles YAML frontmatter parsing
- Simple regex for extracting sections and replacing components
- No complex Effect dependencies = easier to maintain
- Pipeline is fast, reliable, and easy to debug

# Lifting Errors and Absence with fail, none, and left
**Rule:** Use fail, none, and left to create Effect, Option, or Either that represent failure or absence.

### Example
```typescript
import { Effect, Option, Either } from "effect";

// Effect: Represent a failure with an error value
const effect = Effect.fail("Something went wrong"); // Effect<string, never, never>

// Option: Represent absence of a value
const option = Option.none(); // Option<never>

// Either: Represent a failure with a left value
const either = Either.left("Invalid input"); // Either<string, never>
```

**Explanation:**  
- `Effect.fail(error)` creates an effect that always fails with `error`.
- `Option.none()` creates an option that is always absent.
- `Either.left(error)` creates an either that always represents failure.

**Explanation:**  
By lifting errors and absence into these structures, you can handle them declaratively with combinators, rather than relying on exceptions, `null`, or `undefined`.  
This leads to more robust and maintainable code.

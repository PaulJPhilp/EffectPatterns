# Provide Dependencies to Routes
**Rule:** Define dependencies with Effect.Service and provide them to your HTTP server using a Layer.

### Example
This example defines a `Database` service. The route handler for `/users/:userId` requires this service to fetch a user. We then provide a "live" implementation of the `Database` to the entire server using a `Layer`.

```typescript
import * as HttpRouter from "@effect/platform/HttpRouter";
import * as HttpResponse from "@effect/platform/HttpServerResponse";
import * as HttpServer from "@effect/platform/HttpServer";
import { NodeHttpServer, NodeRuntime } from "@effect/platform-node";
import { Effect, Duration, Fiber } from "effect/index";
import { Data } from "effect";

// 1. Define the service interface using Effect.Service
export class Database extends Effect.Service<Database>()("Database", {
  sync: () => ({
    getUser: (id: string) =>
      id === "123"
        ? Effect.succeed({ name: "Paul" })
        : Effect.fail(new UserNotFoundError({ id })),
  }),
}) {}

class UserNotFoundError extends Data.TaggedError("UserNotFoundError")<{
  id: string;
}> {}

// handler producing a `HttpServerResponse`
const userHandler = Effect.flatMap(HttpRouter.params, (p) =>
  Effect.flatMap(Database, (db) => db.getUser(p["userId"] ?? "")).pipe(
    Effect.flatMap(HttpResponse.json)
  )
);

// assemble router & server
const app = HttpRouter.empty.pipe(
  HttpRouter.get("/users/:userId", userHandler)
);

// Create the server effect with all dependencies
const serverEffect = HttpServer.serveEffect(app).pipe(
  Effect.provide(Database.Default),
  Effect.provide(
    NodeHttpServer.layer(
      () => require("node:http").createServer(),
      { port: 3458 }
    )
  )
);

// Create program that manages server lifecycle
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  yield* Effect.logInfo("Starting server on port 3458...");

  const serverFiber = yield* Effect.scoped(serverEffect).pipe(Effect.fork);

  yield* Effect.logInfo("Server started successfully on http://localhost:3458");
  yield* Effect.logInfo("Try: curl http://localhost:3458/users/123");
  yield* Effect.logInfo("Try: curl http://localhost:3458/users/456");

  // Run for a short time to demonstrate
  yield* Effect.sleep(Duration.seconds(3));

  yield* Effect.logInfo("Shutting down server...");
  yield* Fiber.interrupt(serverFiber);
  yield* Effect.logInfo("Server shutdown complete");
});

// Run the program
NodeRuntime.runMain(program);

```

**Explanation:**  
As applications grow, route handlers need to perform complex tasks like accessing a database, calling other APIs, or logging. Hard-coding this logic or manually passing dependencies leads to tightly coupled, untestable code.

Effect's dependency injection system (`Service` and `Layer`) solves this by decoupling a service's interface from its implementation. This is the cornerstone of building scalable, maintainable applications in Effect.

1.  **Modern and Simple**: `Effect.Service` is the modern, idiomatic way to define services. It combines the service's definition and its access tag into a single, clean class structure, reducing boilerplate.
2.  **Testability**: By depending on a service interface, you can easily provide a mock implementation in your tests (e.g., `Database.Test`) instead of the real one (`Database.Live`), allowing for fast, isolated unit tests of your route logic.
3.  **Decoupling**: Route handlers don't know or care *how* the database connection is created or managed. They simply ask for the `Database` service from the context, and the runtime provides the configured implementation.
4.  **Composability**: `Layer`s are composable. You can build complex dependency graphs (e.g., a `Database` layer that itself requires a `Config` layer) that Effect will automatically construct and wire up for you.

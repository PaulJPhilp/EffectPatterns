# Model Validated Domain Types with Brand
**Rule:** Model validated domain types with Brand.

### Example
```typescript
import { Brand, Option } from "effect";

type Email = string & Brand.Brand<"Email">;

const makeEmail = (s: string): Option.Option<Email> =>
  s.includes("@") ? Option.some(s as Email) : Option.none();

// A function can now trust that its input is a valid email.
const sendEmail = (email: Email, body: string) => { /* ... */ };
```

**Explanation:**  
Branding ensures that only validated values are used, reducing bugs and
repetitive checks.

### Anti-Pattern (Avoid)
"Primitive obsession"â€”using raw primitives (`string`, `number`) and performing
validation inside every function that uses them. This is repetitive and
error-prone.

**Explanation:**  
This pattern moves validation to the boundaries of your system. Once a value
has been branded, the rest of your application can trust that it is valid,
eliminating repetitive checks.

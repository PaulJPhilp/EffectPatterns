# Arrays Patterns

## Working with Immutable Arrays using Data.array

Use Data.array to define arrays whose equality is based on their contents, enabling safe, predictable comparisons and functional operations.

### Example

```typescript
import { Data, Equal } from "effect";

// Create two structurally equal arrays
const arr1 = Data.array([1, 2, 3]);
const arr2 = Data.array([1, 2, 3]);

// Compare by value, not reference
const areEqual = Equal.equals(arr1, arr2); // true

// Use arrays as keys in a HashSet or Map
import { HashSet } from "effect";
const set = HashSet.make(arr1);
console.log(HashSet.has(set, arr2)); // true

// Functional operations (map, filter, etc.)
const doubled = arr1.map((n) => n * 2); // Data.array([2, 4, 6])
```

**Explanation:**  
- `Data.array` creates immutable arrays with value-based equality.
- Useful for modeling ordered collections in a safe, functional way.
- Supports all standard array operations, but with immutability and structural equality.

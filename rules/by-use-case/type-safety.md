# Type Safety Patterns

## Modeling Validated Domain Types with Brand

Use Brand to define types like Email, UserId, or PositiveInt, ensuring only valid values can be constructed and used.

### Example

```typescript
import { Brand } from "effect";

// Define a branded type for Email
type Email = string & Brand.Brand<"Email">;

// Function that only accepts Email, not any string
function sendWelcome(email: Email) {
  // ...
}

// Constructing an Email value (unsafe, see next pattern for validation)
const email = "user@example.com" as Email;

sendWelcome(email); // OK
// sendWelcome("not-an-email"); // Type error! (commented to allow compilation)

```

**Explanation:**  
- `Brand.Branded<T, Name>` creates a new type that is distinct from its base type.
- Only values explicitly branded as `Email` can be used where an `Email` is required.
- This prevents accidental mixing of domain types.

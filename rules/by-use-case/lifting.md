# Lifting Patterns

## Lifting Errors and Absence with fail, none, and left

Use fail, none, and left to create Effect, Option, or Either that represent failure or absence.

### Example

```typescript
import { Effect, Option, Either } from "effect";

// Effect: Represent a failure with an error value
const effect = Effect.fail("Something went wrong"); // Effect<string, never, never>

// Option: Represent absence of a value
const option = Option.none(); // Option<never>

// Either: Represent a failure with a left value
const either = Either.left("Invalid input"); // Either<string, never>
```

**Explanation:**  
- `Effect.fail(error)` creates an effect that always fails with `error`.
- `Option.none()` creates an option that is always absent.
- `Either.left(error)` creates an either that always represents failure.

## Lifting Values with succeed, some, and right

Use succeed, some, and right to create Effect, Option, or Either from plain values.

### Example

```typescript
import { Effect, Option, Either } from "effect";

// Effect: Lift a value into an Effect that always succeeds
const effect = Effect.succeed(42); // Effect<never, number, never>

// Option: Lift a value into an Option that is always Some
const option = Option.some("hello"); // Option<string>

// Either: Lift a value into an Either that is always Right
const either = Either.right({ id: 1 }); // Either<never, { id: number }>
```

**Explanation:**  
- `Effect.succeed(value)` creates an effect that always succeeds with `value`.
- `Option.some(value)` creates an option that is always present.
- `Either.right(value)` creates an either that always represents success.

# Structural Equality Patterns

## Comparing Data by Value with Data.struct

Use Data.struct to define objects whose equality is based on their contents, enabling safe and predictable comparisons.

### Example

```typescript
import { Data, Equal } from "effect";

// Create two structurally equal objects
const user1 = Data.struct({ id: 1, name: "Alice" });
const user2 = Data.struct({ id: 1, name: "Alice" });

// Compare by value, not reference
const areEqual = Equal.equals(user1, user2); // true

// Use in a HashSet or as keys in a Map
import { HashSet } from "effect";
const set = HashSet.make(user1);
console.log(HashSet.has(set, user2)); // true
```

**Explanation:**  
- `Data.struct` creates immutable objects with value-based equality.
- Use for domain entities, value objects, and when storing objects in sets or as map keys.
- Avoids bugs from reference-based comparison.

## Working with Immutable Arrays using Data.array

Use Data.array to define arrays whose equality is based on their contents, enabling safe, predictable comparisons and functional operations.

### Example

```typescript
import { Data, Equal } from "effect";

// Create two structurally equal arrays
const arr1 = Data.array([1, 2, 3]);
const arr2 = Data.array([1, 2, 3]);

// Compare by value, not reference
const areEqual = Equal.equals(arr1, arr2); // true

// Use arrays as keys in a HashSet or Map
import { HashSet } from "effect";
const set = HashSet.make(arr1);
console.log(HashSet.has(set, arr2)); // true

// Functional operations (map, filter, etc.)
const doubled = arr1.map((n) => n * 2); // Data.array([2, 4, 6])
```

**Explanation:**  
- `Data.array` creates immutable arrays with value-based equality.
- Useful for modeling ordered collections in a safe, functional way.
- Supports all standard array operations, but with immutability and structural equality.

## Working with Tuples using Data.tuple

Use Data.tuple to define tuples whose equality is based on their contents, enabling safe and predictable comparisons and pattern matching.

### Example

```typescript
import { Data, Equal } from "effect";

// Create two structurally equal tuples
const t1 = Data.tuple(1, "Alice");
const t2 = Data.tuple(1, "Alice");

// Compare by value, not reference
const areEqual = Equal.equals(t1, t2); // true

// Use tuples as keys in a HashSet or Map
import { HashSet } from "effect";
const set = HashSet.make(t1);
console.log(HashSet.has(set, t2)); // true

// Pattern matching on tuples
const [id, name] = t1; // id: number, name: string
```

**Explanation:**  
- `Data.tuple` creates immutable tuples with value-based equality.
- Useful for modeling pairs, coordinates, or any fixed-size, heterogeneous data.
- Supports safe pattern matching and collection operations.

## Detailed Version (For Showcase Channel)

# Effect Patterns Hub CLI v0.4.0 - Production Release 🎉

## Overview

The Effect Patterns Hub CLI is a comprehensive tool for managing Effect-TS patterns and integrating them into AI development workflows. It's built entirely with Effect and demonstrates real-world Effect patterns in action.

## 🎯 Problem It Solves

AI coding assistants are powerful, but they often don't understand Effect-TS patterns well. This CLI bridges that gap by:
1. Installing Effect-TS coding rules directly into AI tool configurations
2. Providing a curated library of 88+ Effect patterns
3. Enabling smart filtering by skill level and use case
4. Automating pattern validation and testing

## 🏗️ Architecture

Built with:
- **@effect/cli** - Type-safe, composable CLI framework
- **@effect/platform** - Cross-platform file system and HTTP
- **@effect/schema** - Runtime type validation
- **Effect** - Core functional effects

Key patterns demonstrated:
- Service layers and dependency injection
- Resource management with Scope
- Error handling with typed errors
- Effect composition and pipelines
- Testing with Effect.gen

## ✨ Features

### 1. AI Tool Integration
```typescript
// Install rules into Cursor IDE
ep install add --tool cursor

// Filter by skill level
ep install add --tool cursor --skill-level beginner

// Filter by use case
ep install add --tool agents --use-case error-management
```

**Supported Tools:**
- Cursor IDE (`.cursor/rules.md`)
- Windsurf IDE (`.windsurf/rules.md`)
- VS Code / Continue.dev (`.vscode/rules.md`)
- Goose AI (`.goosehints`)
- Kilo, Kira, Trae IDEs
- AGENTS.md standard
- Gemini AI (`GEMINI.md`)
- Claude AI (`CLAUDE.md`)

### 2. Pattern Management
```typescript
// Create new pattern with interactive wizard
ep pattern new

// Validate all patterns
ep admin validate

// Test all TypeScript examples
ep admin test

// Run complete pipeline
ep admin pipeline
```

### 3. Release Automation
```typescript
// Preview next release with conventional commits
ep admin release preview

// Create release with auto-versioning
ep admin release create
```

## 📊 Technical Details

**Testing:**
- 73 automated tests
- 100% pass rate
- Integration tests with Pattern Server
- Real service usage (no mocks)

**Code Quality:**
- Zero lint errors
- TypeScript strict mode
- Effect-TS best practices
- Comprehensive error handling

**Documentation:**
- README with CLI section
- Complete setup guide (SETUP.md)
- Testing documentation (TESTING.md)
- Detailed changelog (CHANGELOG-CLI.md)
- Feature roadmap (ROADMAP.md)

## 🚀 Installation

Happy to answer questions! 🚀

## Response Templates

### If someone asks "How does it work?"
```
Great question! The CLI fetches Effect-TS patterns from a pattern server and injects them into your AI tool's configuration files (like .cursor/rules.md). 

When you're coding, your AI assistant reads these rules and can suggest Effect-specific patterns, catch anti-patterns, and help you write better Effect code.

You can filter which patterns to install by skill level (beginner/intermediate/advanced) or use case (error-management, concurrency, etc.)
```

### If someone asks "What patterns are included?"
```
We have 88+ patterns covering:
- Error management (Option, Either, typed errors)
- Resource management (Scope, acquire/release)
- Concurrency (fiber, parallel, sequential)
- Testing (Effect.gen, layers, mocking)
- Services & dependency injection
- Streams & data pipelines
- And much more!

You can browse them all in the repo: https://github.com/PaulJPhilp/EffectPatterns
```

### If someone asks "Can I contribute?"
```
Absolutely! Contributions are very welcome. You can:

1. Add new patterns (see existing patterns for format)
2. Improve documentation
3. Add support for more AI tools
4. Report bugs or suggest features

The codebase itself is a good example of Effect patterns in action, so it's a great learning resource too!
